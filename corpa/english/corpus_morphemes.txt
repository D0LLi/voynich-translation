PREFACE 


The writing of this book on that fascinating and somewhat neglected[1] 
branch of garden literature-- the old English Herbals--has been a 
labour of love, but it could not have been done without all the kind 
help I have had. My grateful thanks are due to the authorities at the 
British Museum , to Professor Burkitt of Cambridge, and very special ly 
to Mr. J. B. Capper for in valuable help . I am indebted to Dr. James, 
the Provost of Eton, for his kind permission to reproduce an 
illustration from a twelfth- century MS. in the Library of Et on College 
for the frontispiece. I find it difficult to express either my 
indebted ness or my gratitude to Dr. and Mrs. Charles Singer, the 
former for all his help and the latter for her generous permission to 
make use of her valuable bibliography of early scientific manuscripts . 
I am further indebted to Dr. Charles Sing er for read ing the chapter on 
the Anglo-Saxon herbals in pro of . For their kind courtesy in answer ing 
my in quiries concerning the MS. herbals in the libraries of their 
respective cathedrals, I of fer my grateful thanks to the Deans of 
Lincoln and Gloucester Cathedrals, and to the Rev. J. N. Needh am for 
information concerning the herbals in the library of Durham Cathedral; 
to the librarians of the following colleges--All Souls' College, 
Oxford; Balliol College, Oxford; Corpus Christi College, Oxford; 
Corpus Christi College, Cambridge; Emmanuel College, Cambridge; 
Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; Magdalene College, Cambridge; 
Peterhouse, Cambridge; Jesus College, Cambridge; St. John 's College, 
Oxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge; to the librarians of Durham 
University, Trinity College, Dublin, the Royal Irish Academy, and the 
National Library of Wales; to the Honble. Lady Cecil for information 
respecting MSS. in the library of the late Lord Amherst of Hackney; 
and to the following owners of private libraries -- the Marquis of Bath, 
Lord Leconfield, Lord Clifden, Mr. T. Fitzroy Fenwick of Cheltenham, 
and Mr. Wynne of Peniarth, Merioneth. For information respecting 
in cunabula herbals in Americ an libraries I am indebted to Dr. Arnold 
Klebs and to Mr. Green of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis. 

No pains have been spared to make the bibliographies as complete as 
possible, but I should be glad to be told of any errors or omissions. 
There are certain editions of _Banckes's Herbal_ and _The Grete 
Herball_ mentioned by authorities such as Ames, Hazlitt, etc., of 
which no copies can now be found in the chief British libraries (see 
p. 204 _et seq._). If any copies of these editions are in private 
libraries I should be grateful to hear of them. The rarest printed 
herbal is "_Arbolayre contenāt la qualitey et vertus proprietiez 
des herbes gōmes et simēces extraite de plusiers tratiers de 
medicine com̄ent davicene de rasis de constat in de ysaac et 
plateaire sel on le con̄u usaige bien correct_." (Supposed to have 
been printed by M. Husz at Lyons.) It is believed that there are only 
two copies of this book now extant. One is in the Bibliothèque 
National e, Paris; the other was sold in London , March 23, 1898, but I 
have been un able to discover who is the present owner . For this or any 
other information I should be most grateful .

THE OLD ENGLISH HERBALS 




CHAPTER I 

THE ANGLO- SAXON HERBALS 

"Everything possible to be be liev'd is an image of truth." 
WILLIAM BLAKE. 


There is a certain pathos attached to the fragments from any great 
wreck, and in study ing the few Saxon manuscripts , treating of herbs, 
which have survived to our day, we find their primary fascination not 
so much in their beauty and interest as in the visions they conjure up 
of those still older manuscripts which perished during the terrible 
Danish in vasions. That books on herbs were studied in England as early 
as the eighth century is certain , for we know that Boniface, " the 
Apostle of the Saxon s," received letters from England asking him for 
books on simple s and complaining that it was difficult to obtain the 
foreign herbs mentioned in those we already possessed.[2] But of these 
manuscripts none have survived , the oldest we possess being of the 
tenth century , and for our knowledge of Anglo-Saxon plant lore we look 
chief ly to those four important manuscripts -- the _Leech Book of Bald_, 
the _Lacnunga_ and the Saxon translation s of the _Herbarium of 
Apuleius_ and the so-called Περὶ Διδαξέων . 

Apart from their intrinsic fascination , there are certain 
considerations which give these manuscripts a peculiar importance . 
Herb lore and folk medicine lag not years , but centuries , behind the 
knowledge of their own day . With in living memory our peasants were 
using, and in the most remote parts of these islands they use still , 
the herbal and other remedies of our Saxon ancestors. They even use 
curious ly similar charms . The herb lore record ed in these manuscripts 
is the herb lore, not of the century in which they were written , but 
of the dim past ages picture d in the oldest parts of _Widsith_ and 
_Beowulf_. To the student of English plant lore, the _Herbarium of 
Apuleius_ and the Περὶ Διδαξέων are less interesting because they 
are translation s, but the more one studies the original Saxon writings 
on herbs and their uses , the more one realises that , just as in 
_Beowulf_ there are suggest ions and traces of an age far older than 
that in which the poem was written , so in these manuscripts are 
embedded beliefs which carry us back to the dawn of history . It is 
this which gives this plant lore its supreme interest . It is almost 
overwhelm ing to recognise that possibly we have here fragments of the 
plant lore of our ancestors who lived when Attila's hor des were 
devastat ing Europe , and that in the charms and ceremonies connected 
with the picking and administering of herbs we are carried back to 
forms of religion so ancient that , compared to it , the worship of 
Woden is modern. Further, it is only in these manuscripts that we find 
this herb lore, for in the whole range of Saxon literature out side 
them there is remark ably little mention of plant life . The great world 
of nature, it is true , is ever present ; the ocean is the back ground of 
the acti on in both _Beowulf_ and _Cynewulf_, and the sound of the wind 
and the sea is in every line. One is conscious of vast trackless 
waste s of heath and moor, of impenetrable forests and terror-infested 
bogs; but of the details of plant life there is scarcely a word. In 
these manuscripts alone do we find what plant life meant to our 
ancestors , and , as with all primitive nations , their belief in the 
mystery of herbs is almost past our civilised understanding. Their 
plant lore, hoary with age , is redolent of a time when the tribes were 
still wandering on the mainland of Europe , and in these first records 
of this plant lore there is the breath of mighty forests , of marsh 
land s and of Nature in her wildest. We are swept back to an epoch when 
man fought with Nature , wresting from her the land , and when the 
unseen powers of evil resented this conquest of their domains. To the 
early Saxon s those unseen powers were an everyday reality. A 
super natural terror brooded over the trackless heath s, the dark mere 
pools were in habited by the water elves. In the wreath ing m ists and 
driving storms of s now and hail they saw the uncouth "moor ganger s," 
" the muckle mark steppers who hold the moor s," or the stalk ing fiends 
of the lonely places , creatures whose baleful eyes sh one like flames 
through the mist. To this day some of our place names in the more 
remote parts of these islands recall the memory of those evil terror s. 
In these manuscripts we are again in an atmosphere of eotens and 
trolls, there are traces of even older terror s, when the first Teuton 
settlers in Europe struggled with the aborigines who lived in caves, 
hints as elusive as the phantom heroes in the Saxon poem s, and as 
unforgettable. 

Still more remarkable is the fact that be neath the superstructure of 
Christian rites to be used when the herbs were being picked or 
administe red we find traces not merely of the ancient heathen 
religion , but of a religion older than that of Woden . It has been 
emphasised by our most eminent authorities that in very early times 
our ancestors had but few chief gods , and it is a remarkable fact that 
there is no mention what ever of Woden in the whole range of Saxon 
literature before the time of Alfred. In those earlier centuries they 
seem to have worship ped a personification of Heaven, and Earth , the 
wife of Heaven, and the Son, whom after ages called Thor. There were 
also Nature deities, Hrede, the personification of the bright ness of 
Summer, and Eostra, the radiant creature of the Dawn. It will be 
remembe red that it was the worship , not of Balder, but of Eostra, 
which the Christian missionaries found so deeply imbedded that they 
adopted her name and transfer red it to East er. For this we have the 
authority of Bede. Separate from these beneficent powers were the 
destroy ing and harmful powers of Nature -- darkness , storm, frost and 
the deadly vapours of moor land and fen, personified in the giants, the 
ogres, the furious witches that rode the wind s and waves; in fact , the 
whole hor de of demons of sea and land and sky. It is the traces of 
these most ancient forms of religion which give to the manuscripts 
their strongest fascination . 

Many of us miss all that is most worth learning in old books through 
regard ing anything in them that is unfamiliar as merely quaint, if not 
ridiculous. This attitude seals a book as effectually and as 
permanently as it seals a sensitive human being . There is only one way 
of understanding these old writer s, and that is to forget our s elves 
entirely and to try to look at the world of nature as they did. It is 
not " much learning " that is required, but sympathy and imagination . In 
the case of these Saxon manuscripts we are repaid a thousandfold; for 
they transport us to an age far older than our own , and yet in some 
way s so young that we have lost its magic key. For we learn not only 
of herbs and the end less uses our forefathers made of them, but , if we 
try to read them with understanding , these books open for us a magic 
case ment through which we look upon the past bath ed in a glam our of 
romance. Our Saxon ancestors may have been a rude and hardy race, but 
they did not live in an age of materialism as we do . In their writings 
on herbs and their uses we see " as through a glass dark ly " a time when 
grown men believed in elves and goblins as natural ly as they believed 
in trees, an age when it was the belief of everyday folk that the air 
was peopled with unseen powers of evil against whose machinations 
definite remedies must be applied. They believed , as in deed the people 
of all ancient civilisations have believed , that natural forces and 
natural objects were end ued with mysterious powers whom it was 
necessary to propitiate by special prayers. Not only the stars of 
heaven, but springs of water and the simple way side herbs, were to 
them direct ly associate d with unseen being s. There are times when one 
is reminded for cib ly of that worship of Demeter, "nearer to the Earth 
which some have thought they could discern behind the definite ly 
national my thology of Homer." They believed that the sick could be 
cured by conjurations and charms , as firm ly as we believe to- day in 
curing them by suggest ion -- is there any real difference between these 
methods ? -- and when one read s the charms which they used in 
administering their herbs one cannot help wondering whether these were 
handed down traditional ly from the Sumerians, those ancient 
in habitants of Mesopotamia who five thousand years before Christ used 
charms for curing the sick which have now been partial ly deciphe red 
from the cuneiform in scriptions. But before study ing the plant lore 
there in contained, it may be as well to take a preliminary survey of 
the four most important manuscripts . 

The oldest Saxon book deal ing with the virtues of herbs which we 
possess is the _Leech Book of Bald_, dating from about A.D. 900-950. 
Unlike some other MS. herbals of which only a few tatte red pages 
remain, this perfect specimen of Saxon work has nothing fragile about 
it . The vellum is as strong and in as good condition as when it first 
lay clean and untouched under the hand of the scribe--Cild by 
name--who penned it with such skill and loving care. One 's imagination 
runs riot when one hand les this beautiful book , now over a thousand 
years old , and wonders who were its success ive owners and how it has 
survived the wars and other des tructive age ncies through all these 
centuries . But we only know that , at least for a time , it was 
shelte red in that most romantic of all English monasteries, 
Glastonbury.[3] This Saxon manuscript has a dignity which is unique, 
for it is the oldest exist ing leech book written in the vernacular . In 
a lecture delivered before the Royal College of Physicians in 1903, 
Dr. J. F. Payne commented on the remarkable fact that the Anglo-Saxon s 
had a much wider knowledge of herbs than the doctors of Salerno , the 
oldest school of medicine and oldest university in Europe . "No 
treatise," he said, " of the School of Salerno contemporaneous with the 
_Leech Book of Bald_ is known , so that the Anglo-Saxon s had the credit 
of priority. Their Leech Book was the first medical treatise written 
in Western Europe which can be said to belong to modern history , that 
is , which was produced after the decadence and decline of the 
classical medicine, which belong s to ancient history .... It seems fair 
to regard it [ the Leech Book ], in a sense, as the embryo of modern 
English medicine, and at all even ts the earliest medical treatise 
produced by any of the modern nations of Europe ." The Anglo-Saxon s 
created a vernacular literature to which the continental nations at 
that time could show no parallel, and in the branch of literature 
connected with medicine, in those days based on a knowledge of herbs 
( when it was not magic ), their position was unique. Moreover, the fact 
that the Leech Book was written in the vernacular is in itself 
remarkable , for it point s to the existence of a class of men who were 
not Latin scholars and yet were able and will ing to read books . The 
Leech Book belong s to the literary period commonly known as the school 
of Alfred. It was probably written short ly after Alfred's death, but 
it is more than probable that it is a copy of a much older manuscript , 
for what is known as the third book of the Leech Book is evident ly a 
short er and older work incorporated by the scribe when he had finished 
the Leech Book proper . 

The book itself was written under the direct ion of one Bald, who , if 
he were not a personal friend of King Alfred's , had at any rate access 
to the king's correspondence; for one chapter consists of 
prescriptions sent by Helias, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to the king.[4] 
We learn the names of the first owner and scribe from lines in Latin 
verse at the end of the second part of the MS. 

"Bald is the owner of this book , which he order ed Cild to write, 
Earnest ly I pray here all men, in the name of Christ , 
That no treacherous person take this book from me, 
N either by for ce nor by the ft nor by any false statement. 
Why? Beca use the richest treasure is not so dear to me 
As my dear books which the Grace of Christ attends." 

The book consists of 10 9 leaves and is written in a large, bold hand 
and one or two of the initial letters are very faint ly illuminated. 
The writing is an except ionally fine specimen of Saxon penmanship. On 
many of the pages there are mysterious mark s, but it is impossible to 
conjecture their meaning . It has been suggested that they point to the 
source s from which the book was compiled and were inserted by the 
original owner . 

The _Leech Book of Bald_ was evident ly the man ual of a Saxon doctor, 
and he refers to two other doctors -- Dun and Oxa by name--who had given 
him prescriptions . The position of the leech in those days must have 
been very try ing, for he was subjected to the obviously un fair 
competiti on of the high er clergy, many of whom enjoyed a reputation 
for work ing miraculous cures.[5] The leech being so inferior in 
position , it is not surprising that his medical knowledge did not 
advance on scientific lines . He relied on the old heathen 
superstitions, probably from an instinctive feel ing that in pagan 
religion , combined with the herb lore which had been handed down 
through the ages , the mass of the people had a deep-rooted faith. 
No th ing is more obvious in the Leech Book than the fact that the 
virtues ascribed to the different herbs are based not on the personal 
knowledge of the writer , but on the old herb lore . This gives the 
Leech Book its special fascination ; for it is the oldest surviv ing 
manuscript in which we can learn the herb lore of our ancestors , 
handed down to them from what dim past ages we can only surmise. We 
have , therefore , to bear in mind that what may strike our modern minds 
as quaint, or even grotesque, is in the majority of instances a 
distorted form of lore which doubt less suffe red many changes during 
the early centuries of our era. N early all that is most fascinating in 
the Leech Book is of very ancient Indo-Germanic or Eastern origin , but 
one cannot help wondering how much the Saxon s incorporated of the herb 
lore of the ancient Britons. Does not Pliny tell us that the Britons 
gathered herbs with such striking ceremonies that it would seem as 
though the Britons had taught them to the Persians? 

One cannot read Bald's manuscript without being struck by his 
remarkable knowledge of native plants and garden herbs. We are 
inferior to our continental neighbours in so many arts that it is 
pleasant to find that in the ancient art of garden ing and in their 
knowledge of herbs our Saxon forefathers excelled. It has been pointed 
out by eminent authorities that the Anglo-Saxon s had names for , and 
used , a far larger number of plants than the continental nations . In 
the _Herbarium of Apuleius_ , including the addition s from Dioscorides , 
only 185 plants are mentioned , and this was one of the standard works 
of the early Middle Ages . In the _Herbarius_ of 1484, the earliest 
herbal printed in German y, only 150 plants are record ed , and in the 
German _Herbarius_ of 1485 there are 380. But from various source s it 
has been computed that the Anglo-Saxon s had names for , and used , at 
least 500 plants .[6] One feels instinctive ly that the love of flowers 
and gardens was as deep-rooted in our ancestors as it is in our nati on 
to- day, and though we do not know exact ly what they grew in their 
gardens -- which they called wyrtȝerd (literally, herb -yard) -- we do 
know that the marigolds, sunflowers, peonies, violets and 
gilly- flowers which make the cottage gardens of England so gay and 
full of colour to- day were also the common est plants in the Saxon 
gardens . Fashions in large gardens have changed through out the 
centuries , and there are state ly gardens in this country famed the 
world over . But in regard to our cottage gardens we are staunch ly 
conservative, and it is assu red ly the cottage garden which is 
characteristic al ly English . Incidentally, one cannot help regrett ing 
that so many of our old Saxon plant names have fall en into disuse. 
"Waybroad," for instance, is much more des criptive than "plantain," 
which is misleading.[7] "Maythen" also is sure ly pre fer able to 
"camomile," and "wergulu" is more characteristic of that fierce we ed 
than "nettle." Those of us who are garden ers will certain ly agree that 
"unfortraedde" is the right name for knotweed. And is not " joy of the 
ground " a deli ghtful name for periwinkle? 

The oldest illustrated herbal which has come down to us from Saxon 
times is the translation of the Latin _Herbarium Apuleii 
Platonici_.[8] The original Latin work is believed to date from the 
fifth century , though no copy so ancient as this is in existence now . 
The name Apuleius Platonicus is possibly fictitious and nothing is 
known of the writer , who was , of course, distinct from Apuleius 
Madaurensis, the author of the _Golden Ass_. The Saxon translation of 
this herbal ( now in the British Museum ) is supposed to date from A.D. 
10 00-1050, and belong s to the school of Ælfric of Canterbury. The 
frontispiece is a colour ed picture in which Plato is rep resented 
holding a large volume which is being given him by Æsculapius and the 
Centaur, and on the other side of the page is a blue circle spotted 
with white and red , with in which is the name of the book : "Herbarium 
Apuleii Plato nici quod accepit ab Escolapio et Chir one centauro 
magistro Achillis." The book consists of 132 chapter s, in each of 
which a herb is described , and there are accompanying illustrations of 
the herbs. Throughout the book there are also remarkable pictures of 
snake s, scorpions and unknown winged creatures . It has been pointed 
out that the figures of herbs are obviously not from the original 
plants , but are copied from older figures , and these from others older 
still , and one wonders what the original pictures were like . It is 
interesting to think that perhaps the illustrations in this Saxon 
herbal are direct ly des cended, so to speak, from the drawings of 
Cratevas,[9] Dionysius or Metrodorus, of whom Pliny tells us " They 
drew the like ness of herbs and wrote under them their effect s ." The 
picture of the lily is very attractive in spite of the fact that the 
flowers are painted pale blue . The stamens in the figure stand out 
beyond the petals and look like rays of light, with a general effect 
that is curious ly pleasing. One of the most interesting figures is 
that of the mandrake ( painted in a deep madder ), which embodies the 
old legend that it was death to dig up the root , and that therefore a 
dog was tied to a rope and made to drag it up . It is the opinion of 
some authorities that these figures show the influence of the school 
rep resented by the two splen did Vienna manuscripts of Dioscorides 
dating from the fifth and seventh centuries . There is no definite 
evidence of this , and though the illustrations in the Saxon manuscript 
show the influence of the classical tradition, they are poor compared 
with those in the Vienna manuscript . To some extent at least the 
drawings in this herbal must necessari ly have been copies , for many of 
the plants are species unknown in this country .

From the Saxon translation of the _Herbarium of Apuleius_ 
(Cott. Vit., C. 3, folio 19_a_)] 

The Saxon translation of the Περὶ Διδαξέων (Harl. 6258) is a th in 
volume bad ly mutilated in parts . Herr Max Löwenbeck[10] has shown that 
this is in part translated from a treatise by an eleventh - century 
writer , Petrocellus or Petronius, of the School of Salerno -- the 
original treatise being entitled _Practica Petrocelli Salernitani_.[11] 
As has been pointed out by many eminent authorities , the School of 
Salerno , being a surviv al of Greek medicine, was uncontaminated by 
superstitious medicine . Consequent ly there are striking difference s 
between this and the other Saxon manuscripts . The large majority of the 
herbs mentioned are those of Southern Europe , and the pharmacy is very 
simple compared with the number of herbs in prescriptions of native 
origin . As Dr. J. F. Payne [12] has pointed out , Herr Löwenbeck's 
important discover y does not account for the whole of the English book . 
The order of the chapter s differs from that of the Salernitan writer; 
there are passages not to be found in the _Practica _, and in some 
places the English text gives a full er read ing . It is fair ly evident 
that the Saxon treatise is at least in part indebted to the 
_Passionarius_ by Gariopontus, another Salernitan writer of the same 
period . 

The _Lacnunga_ (Harl. 585 ), an original work , and one of the oldest 
and most interesting manuscripts , is a small , thick volume without any 
illustrations . Some of the letters are illuminated and some are rude ly 
ornamented. At the top of the first page there is the in scription 
"Liber Humfredi Wanley," and it is interesting , therefore , to realise 
that the British Museum owes this treasure to the zealous antiquarian 
whose efforts during the closing years of the seventeenth and early 
years of the eighteenth century resc ued so many valuable Saxon and 
other MSS. from oblivion.[13] 

To the student of folk lore and folk custom these source s of herb lore 
are of remarkable interest for the light they throw on the beliefs and 
custom s of humble everyday people in Anglo-Saxon times . Of kings and 
warriors, of bards and of great ladies we can read in other Saxon 
literature , and all so vivid ly that we see their halls, the long 
hear th s on which the fires were piled, the open ing s in the roof 
through which the smoke pass ed . We see the men with their "byrnies" of 
ring mail, their crested helmets, their leather-cove red shields and 
deadly short swords. We see them and their women kind wearing golde n 
ornaments at their feasts, the tables laden with boars' flesh and 
ven is on and chased cups of ale and mead. We see these same halls at 
night with the men sleep ing, their "byrnies" and helmets hang ing near 
them, and in the dim light we can make out also the trophies of the 
chase hang ing on the walls. We read of their mighty deed s, and we know 
at least something of the ideals and the thought s of their great men 
and heroes . But what of that vast number of the human kind who were 
always in the back ground ? What of the hewers of wood and drawers of 
water , the swineherds, the shepherds, the carpenters, the hedgers and 
cobblers? I s it not wonderful to think that in these manuscripts we 
can learn , at least to some extent , what plant life meant to these 
everyday folk ? And even in these days to understand what plant life 
mean s to the true country man is to get into very close touch with him. 
Not only has suburban life separated the great concentrated mass es of 
our people from their birth right of meadows, fields and wood s; of 
Nature , in her untamed splendour and mystery , most of them have never 
had so much as a momentary glimpse. But in Saxon times even the to wns 
were not far from the unreclaimed marsh es and forests , and to the 
peasant in those days they were full not only of seen , but also of 
unseen perils. There was probably not a Saxon child who did not know 
something of the a we of waste places and impenetrable forests . Even 
the hamlets lay on the very edge of forests and moor s, and to the 
peasant these were haunted by giant, elf and monster, as in the more 
in access ible parts of these islands they are haunted still to those 
who reta in something of primitive imagination . And when we study the 
plant lore of these people we realise that prince and peasant a like 
used the simple but mysterious herbs not only to cure them of both 
physical and ment al ills, but to guard them from these unseen 
monsters. Of the reverence they paid to herbs we begin to have some 
dim apprehensi on when we read of the ceremonies connected with the 
picking and administering of them. 

But , first , what can we learn of the beliefs as to the origin of 
disease? Concern ing this the great bulk of the folk lore in these 
manuscripts is apparently of native Teuton ic origin , or rather it 
would be more correct to speak of its origin as Indo-Germanic ; for the 
same doctrines are to be found among all Indo-Germanic people s, and 
even in the Vedas, notably the Atharva Veda. Of these beliefs , the 
doctrine of the "elf-shot" occupies a large space , the long est chapter 
in the third book of the _Leech Book of Bald_ being entirely " against 
elf -disease." We know from their literature that to our Saxon 
ancestors waste places of moor and forest and marsh es were the resort 
of a host of super natural creatures at enmity with man kind . In the 
_Leech Book of Bald_ disease is large ly ascribed to these elves , whose 
shafts produced ill ness in their victims. We read of be org-æl fen, 
dun-æl fen, muntælfen. But our modern word "elf" feeb ly represen ts 
these creatures , who were more akin to the "mark-stalker s," to the 
creatures of darkness with loath some eyes, rather than to the fair ies 
with whom we now associate the name . For the most part these elves of 
ancient times were joy less imperso nations and creatures not of sun but 
of darkness and wint er. In the gloom and solitude of the forest , 
" where the bitter wormwood stood pale grey" and where " the hoar stones 
lay thick ," the black , giant elves had their dwelling. They claim ed 
the forest for their own and hated man because bit by bit he was 
wresting the forest from them. Yet they made for man those mystic 
swords of super human work man ship engraved with magic runes and dip ped 
when red hot in blood or in a broth of poisonous herbs and twigs. We 
do not understand , we can only ask, why did they make them ? What is 
the meaning of the myth ? The water elves recall the sea monsters who 
attended Grendel's dam, imperso nations of the fury of the waves, akin 
to Hnikarr, and again other water elves of the cavernous bed of ocean , 
primeval deadly creatures , in ha bit ing a like the sea and the desolate 
fens, " where the elk-s edge waxed in the water ." If some were akin to 
the For mori of the baleful fogs in Irish myth ic history and the 
Mallt-y-nos, those she- demons of marsh y land s immortalised by the 
We lsh bards , creatures huge and uncouth " with grey and gla ring eyes, " 
there were others who exceeded in beauty anything human . When Cædm on 
wrote of the beauty of Sarah, he described her as "sheen as an elf ." 
With the pass ing of the centuries we have we ll-nigh for gotten the 
black elves , though they are still real it ies to the Highlander and too 
real for him to speak of them. But have we not the descendant s of the 
sheen bright elves in the works of Shakespeare, Milt on and Shelley? 
One feels very sure that our Saxon ancestors would have under stood 
that glittering elf Ariel as few of us are cap able of understanding 
him. He is the old English bright elf . Did not Prospero sub due him 
with magic , as our ancestors used magic songs in administering herbs 
" to quell the elf " ? Here is one such song from the _Leech Book of 
Bald_, and at the end a conjurati on to bury the elf in the earth . 

"I have wreath ed round the wound s 
The best of heal ing wreath s 
That the baneful sores may 
N either burn nor burst, 
Nor find their way further , 
Nor turn foul and fallow. 
Nor thump and throle on , 
Nor be wicked wound s, 
Nor dig deeply down ; 
But he himself may hold 
In a way to health. 
Let it ache thee no more 
Than ear in Earth ache th . 

" Sing also this many times , 'May earth bear on thee with all her might 
and main.'" -- _Leech Book of Bald_, III. 63. 

This was for one " in the water elf disease ," and we read that a person 
so afflicted would have livid nails and tea rful eyes, and would look 
down wards . Amongst the herbs to be administe red when the charm was 
sung over him were a yew-berry, lupin, helenium , marsh mallow, dock 
elder , wormwood and strawberry leaves . 

Goblins and night m are were regarded as at least akin to elves , and we 
find the same herbs were to be used against them, betony being of 
peculiar efficacy against "monstrous nocturnal visions and against 
fri ghtful visions and dreams."[14] The malicious elves did not con fine 
their attacks to human being s; references to elf-shot cattle are 
numerous. I quote the following from the chapter " against elf 
disease ." 

"For that ilk [_i. e._ for one who is elf -shot]. 

"Go on Thurs day even ing when the sun is set where thou 
know est that helenium stand s, then sing the Benedicite and 
Pater Noster and a litany and stick thy knife into the wort, 
make it stick fast and go away ; go again when day and night 
just divide; at the same period go first to church and cross 
thyself and commend thyself to God; then go in silence and , 
though anything soever of an awful sort or man meet thee, 
say not thou to him any word ere thou come to the wort which 
on the even ing before thou mark edst; then sing the 
Benedicite and the Pater Noster and a litany , delve up the 
wort, let the knife stick in it ; go again as quick ly as thou 
art able to church and let it lie under the altar with the 
knife ; let it lie till the sun be up, wash it afterwards, 
and make into a drink with bishopwort and lichen off a 
crucifix; boil in milk thrice, thrice pour holy water upon 
it and sing over it the Pater Noster , the Credo and the 
Gloria in Excels is Deo, and sing upon it a litany and score 
with a s word round about it on three sides a cross , and then 
after that let the man drink the wort ; So on it will be well 
with him ."-- _Leech Book_, III. 62. 

The instruction s for a horse or cattle that are elf-shot runs thus:-- 

"If a horse or other neat be elf-shot take sorrel- seed or 
Scotch wax, let a man sing twelve Masses over it and put 
holy water on the horse or on what soever neat it be ; have 
the worts always with the e. For the same take the eye of a 
broken needle, give the horse a prick with it , no harm shall 
come ."-- _Leech Book of Bald_, I. 88 . 

Another prescription for an elf-shot horse runs thus:-- 

"If a horse be elf-shot , then take the knife of which the 
ha ft is the horn of a fallow ox and on which are three brass 
nails , then write upon the horse 's for ehead Christ 's mark 
and on each of the limb s which thou mayst feel at : then take 
the left ear, prick a hole in it in silence , this thou shalt 
do ; then strike the horse on the back , then will it be 
whole . -- And write upon the hand le of the knife these words -- 

" Benedicite omnia opera Domini dominum. 

" Be the elf what it may , this is mighty for him to 
am end ."-- _Leech Book of Bald_, I. 65.[15] 

Closely all ied to the doctrine of the elf-shot is that of "flying 
venom." It is , of course, possible to regard the phrase as the graphic 
Anglo-Saxon way of describing infectious disease s; but the various 
synonymous phrase s, " the on - flying things ," " the loathed things that 
rove through the land ," suggest something of more malignant acti vity. 
As a recent lead ing article in _The Times_ show s, we are as a matter 
of fact not much wiser than our Saxon ancestors as to the origin of an 
epidemic such as in fluenza.[16] Indeed, to talk of "catching" a cold 
or any infectious disease would have struck an Anglo-Saxon as 
ludicrous, man kind being rather the victims of "flying venom." In the 
alliterative lay in the _Lacnunga_, part of which is given be low, the 
wind is described as blow ing these venom s, which produced disease in 
the bodies on which they light ed , their evil effect s being 
subsequently blown away by the magic ian's song and the efficacy of 
salt and water and herbs. This is generally supposed to be in its 
origin a heathen lay of great antiquity preserve d down to Christian 
times , when allusions to the new religion were inserted . It is written 
in the We ssex dialect and is believed to be of the tenth century , but 
it is undoubted ly a reminiscence of some far older lay . The lay or 
charm is in praise of nine sacred herbs ( one a tree)--mug wort, 
waybroad (plantain ), s time (watercress ), atterlo the ( ? ), may then 
(camomile ), we rgulu (nettle ), crab apple, chervil and fennel. 

" These nine attack 
against nine venom s. 
A worm came creep ing, 
he to re as under a man . 
Then took Woden 
nine magic twigs , 
[&] then smote the serpent 
that he in nine [bits] dispersed. 
Now these nine herbs have power 
against nine magic out casts 
against nine venom s 
& against nine flying things 
[ & have might ] against the loathed things 
that over land rove . 
Against the red venom s 
against the runlan [?] venom 
against the white venom 
against the blue [?] venom 
against the yellow venom 
against the green venom 
against the dusky venom 
against the brown venom 
against the purple venom . 
Against worm blast 
against water blast 
against thorn blast 
against thistle blast 
Against ice blast 
Against venom blast 
. . . . . . . 
if any venom come 
flying from east 
or any come from nor th 
[ or any from south] 
or any from west 
over man kind 
I alone know a running river 
and the nine serpent s be hold [it] 
All weeds must 
now to herbs give way , 
Seas dissolve 
[and] all salt water 
when I this venom 
from thee blow ." [17] 

In the chapter in the _Leech Book of Bald_ [18] contain ing the 
prescriptions sent by the Patriarch of Jerusalem to King Alf red , we 
find among the virtues of the " white stone" that it is " power ful 
against flying venom and against all uncouth things ," and in another 
pass age [19] that these venom s are particular ly dangerous "fifteen 
nights ere Lammas and after it for five and thirty nights : leech es who 
were wisest have taught that in that month no man should any where 
we aken his body except there were a necessity for it ." In the most 
ancient source of Anglo-Saxon medicine -- the _Lacnunga_ -- we find the 
following "salve" for flying venom :-- 

"A salve for flying venom . Take a handful of hammer wort and 
a handful of may the (camomile ) and a handful of waybroad 
(plantain ) and root s of water dock , seek those which will 
float, and one eggshell full of clean honey, then take clean 
butter , let him who will help to work up the salve melt it 
thrice : let one sing a mass over the worts , before they are 
put together and the salve is wrought up."[20] 

But it is in the doctrine of the worm as the ultimate source of 
disease that we are carried back to the most ancient of sagas. The 
drag on and the worm , the supreme enemy of man , which play so 
dominat ing a part in Saxon literature , are here set down as the source 
of all ill . In the alliterative lay in the _Lacnunga_ the open ing 
lines describe the war between Woden and the Serpent. Disease arose 
from the nine fragments into which he smote the serpent , and these 
disease s, blown by the wind , are counteracted by the nine magic twigs 
and salt water and herbs with which the disease is again blown away 
from the victim by the power of the magic ian's song . This is the 
atmosphere of the great earth- worm Fafnir in the Volsunga Saga and the 
drag on in all folk tales, the great beast with whom the heroes of all 
nations have contended. Further, it is noteworthy that not only in 
Anglo-Saxon medicine, but for many centuries afterwards, even mi nor 
ailments were ascribed to the pre sence of a worm -- notably to othache. 
In the _Leech Book_ we find tooth ache ascribed to a worm in the tooth 
(see _Leech Book_, II. 121). It is impossible in a book of this size 
to deal with the comparative folk lore of this subject, but in pass ing 
it is interesting to recall an incantation for tooth ache from the 
Babylonia n cuneiform text s[21] in which we find perhaps the oldest 
example of this belief . 

"The Marshes created the Worm , 
Came the Worm and we pt before Shamash, 
What wilt thou give me for my food? 
What wilt thou give me to devour? 
. . . . . . . 
Let me drink among the teeth 
And set me on the gums, 
That I may dev our the blood of the teeth 
And of the gums destroy their strength. 
Then shall I hold the bolt of the door. 
. . . . . . . 
So must thou say this , O Worm , 
May Ea smite thee with the might of his fist ." 

Closely in terwo ven with these elements of Indo-Germanic origin we find 
the ancient Eastern doctrine which ascribes disease to demoniac 
possess ion. The exorcisms were original ly heathen charms , and even in 
the _Leech Book_ there are many interesting surviv al s of these , 
although Christian rites have to a large extent been substituted for 
them. Both mandrake and periwinkle were supposed to be end owed with 
mysterious powers against demoniac al possess ion. At the end of the 
description of the mandrake in the _Herbarium of Apuleius_ there is 
this prescription :-- 

"For wit less ness, that is devil sickness or demoniac al 
possess ion, take from the body of this same wort mandrake by 
the we ight of three pennie s, administe r to drink in warm 
water as he may find most convenient--so on he will be 
healed."--_Herb. Ap._, 32. 

Of periwinkle we read :-- 

"This wort is of good advant age for many purpose s, that is 
to say first against devil sickness and demoniac al 
possess ions and against snake s and wild beast s and against 
poisons and for various wishes and for envy and for terror 
and that thou mayst have grace , and if thou hast the wort 
with thee thou shalt be prosperous and ever acceptable. This 
wort thou shalt pluck thus, say ing, ' I pray thee, vinca 
pervinca, thee that art to be had for thy many use ful 
qualitie s, that thou come to me glad blossom ing with thy 
ma in ful ness, that thou out f it me so that I be shielded and 
ever prosperous and undamaged by poisons and by water ; ' when 
thou shalt pluck this wort thou shalt be clean of every 
un clean ness, and thou shalt pick it when the moon is nine 
nights old and el even nights and thirteen nights and thirty 
nights and when it is one night old ."--_Herb. Ap. _ 

[Illustration: MANDRAKE FROM A SAXON HERBAL 
(Sloane 1975, folio 49_a_)] 

In the treatment of disease we find that the material remedies , by 
which I mean remedies dev oid of any mystic meaning , are with few 
exception s entirely herbal . The herb drink s were made up with ale , 
milk or vinegar, many of the pot ions were made of herbs mixed with 
honey, and ointments were made of herbs work ed up with butter . The 
most scientific prescription is that for a vapour bath ,[22] and there 
are suggest ions for what may be come fashion able once more -- herb bath s. 
The majority of the prescriptions are for common ailments , and one 
cannot help being struck by the number there are for broken heads, 
bleed ing noses and bite s of mad dog s. How ever ignorant one may be of 
medicine, it is impossible to read these old prescriptions without 
real is ing that our ancestors were an un commonly hardy race, for the 
majority of the remedies would kill any of us modern we akl ing s, 
even if in robust health when they were administe red . At times one 
cannot help wondering whether in those days , as not in frequent ly 
happens now , the bul let in was issued that " the opera tion was quite 
successful, but the patient died of shock!" And , as further evidence 
of the old truth that there is nothing new under the sun , it is 
pleasant to find that doctors , even in Saxon days , prescribed 
"carri age exercise ," and more over endeavoured to sweet en it by 
all ow ing the patient to "lap up honey" first . This prescription runs 
thus:-- 

" Against want of appetite. Let them, after the night 's fast , 
lap up honey, and let them seek for themselves fatigue in 
riding on horse back or in a wain or such conveyance as they 
may endure ."-- _Leech Book_, II. 7. 

In the later herbals , "beauty" recipes are , as is well known , a 
conspicuous feature, but they find a place also in these old 
manuscripts . In the third book ( the oldest part ) of the _Leech Book_ 
there is a prescription for sun burn which runs thus:-- 

"For sun burn boil in butter tender ivy twigs , smear 
there with ."-- _Leech Book_, III. 29. 

And in _Leech Book_ II. we find this prescription :-- 

" That all the body may be of a clean and glad and bright 
hue, take oil and dregs of old wine equall y much , put them 
into a mortar, mingle well together and smear the body with 
this in the sun ."-- _Leech Book_, II. 65. 

Prescript ions for hair fall ing off are fair ly numerous , and there are 
even two -- somewhat drastic -- prescriptions for hair which is too thick . 
Sowb read and water cress were both used to make hair grow, and in 
_Leech Book_ I. there is this prescription :-- 

"If a man's hair fall off , work him a salve . Take the mickle 
wolf's bane and viper 's bugloss and the netherward part of 
bur dock , work the salve out of that wort and out of all 
these and out of that butter of which no water hath come . If 
hair fall off , boil the polypody fern and foment the head 
with that so warm . In case that a man be bal d , Plinius the 
mickle leech saith this leech dom : ' Take dead bees , burn them 
to ashes , add oil upon that , see the very long over gledes, 
then strain, wr ing out and take leaves of wil low, pound 
them, pour the juice into the oil ; boil again for a while on 
gledes, stra in them, smear there with after the 
bath .'" -- _Leech Book_, I. 8 7. 

The two prescriptions for hair which is too thick are in the same 
chapter :-- 

"In order that the hair may not wax, take emmets' egg s, rub 
them up, smudge on the place , never will any hair come up 
there ." Again : " if hair be too thick , take a swal low, burn 
it to ashes under a tile and have the ashes she d on ." 

There are more pro visions against disease s of the eye than against any 
other complaint, and it is probably because of the pre valence of these 
in old en days that we still have so many of the superstitions 
connected with springs of water . Both may then (camomile ) and wild 
let tuce were used for the eyes . In the following for mistiness of eyes 
there is a touch of pathos :-- 

"For mistiness of eyes, many men, lest their eyes should 
suffe r the disease , look into cold water and then are able 
to see far .... The eyes of an old man are not sharp of 
sight, then shall he wake up his eyes with rub b ing s, with 
walking s, with riding s, either so that a man bear him or 
convey him in a wain . And they shall use little and care ful 
meat s and comb their head s and drink wormwood before they 
take food. Then shall a salve be wrought for unsharpsighted 
eyes ; take pepper and be at it and a somewhat of salt and 
wine ; that will be a good salve ." 

One prescription is unique, for the "herb" which one is direct ed to 
use is not to be found in any other herbal in existence . This is "rind 
from Paradise ." There is a grim humour about the scribe 's comm ent , and 
one cannot help wondering what was the origin of the prescription :-- 

" Some teach us against bite of add er, to speak one word 
'faul.' It may not hurt him. Against bite of snake if the 
man pro cures and eat eth rind which cometh out of Paradise , 
no venom will hurt him. Then said he that wrote this book 
that the rind was hard gotten ." 

These manuscripts are so full of word pictures of the treatment of 
disease that one feels if one were transport ed back to those days it 
would in most cases be possible to tell at a gla nce the "cures" 
various people were under going. Let us visi t a Saxon ham let and go and 
see the sick folk in the cottage s. On our way we meet a man with a 
fawn 's skin decorated with little bunches of herbs dangl ing from his 
should ers, and we know that he is a suffe rer from night mare.[23] 
Another has a wreath of clove- wort tied with a red th read round his 
neck. He is a lunatic, but , as the moon is on the wane, his family 
hope that the wearing of these herbs will prove be neficial. We enter a 
dark one -roomed hut, the dwell ing of one of the swineherds, but he is 
not at his work ; for it seem ed to him that his head turned about and 
that he was far ing with turned brains. He had consulted the leech and , 
suggest ion cures being then rather more common than now , the leech had 
advised him to s it calmly by his fire side with a linen cloth wrung out 
in sp ring water on his head and to wa it till it was dry . He does so , 
and , to quote the words with which nearly all Saxon prescriptions end , 
we feel " it will soon be well with him ." Let us w end our way to the 
cobbler, a sullen, taci turn man who find s his live ly young wife 's 
chatter unendurable. We find him look ing more gloom y than usual, for 
he has eaten nothing all day and now s its moodi ly consum ing a raw 
radish. But there is purpose in this . Does not the ancient leech dom 
say that , if a radish be eaten raw after fast ing all day, no woman 's 
chatter the next day can annoy? In another cottage we find that a 
patient suffe ring from elf-shot is to be smoke d with the fumes of 
herbs. A huge quern stone which has been in the fire on the hear th 
all day is drag ged out , the prepared herbs -- w all wort and mugwort -- are 
scattered upon it and also under neath , then cold water is pour ed on 
and the patient is reeked with the steam " as hot as he can endure 
it ." [24] Smok ing sick folk , especially for demoniac possess ion, is a 
world-wide practice and of very ancient origin . There is no space here 
to attempt to touch on the comparative folk lore of this sub ject. 
Moreover, fumigating the sick with herbs is closely akin to the 
burn ing of incense. Even in ancient Babylonia n days fumigating with 
herbs was practised.[25] It was very common all through the Middle 
Ages in most parts of Europe , and that it has not even yet died out is 
shown by the extract from _The Times_ given be low.[26] I have 
purpose ly put in juxta position the translation of the ancient 
Babylonia n tablet and the extract from _The Times_ . 

It is noteworthy that not only human being s, but cattle and swine 
were smoke d with the fumes of herbs. In the _Lacnunga_, for sick 
cattle we find -- "Take the wort, put it upon gle des and fennel and 
hassuck and 'cotton' and incense. Burn all together on the side on 
which the wind is . Make it reek upon the cattle . Make five cross es of 
hassuck grass, set them on four sides of the cattle and one in the 
middle. Sing about the cattle the Benedicite and some litanies and the 
Pater Noster . Sprinkle holy water upon them, burn about them incense 
and cott on and let some one set a value on the cattle , let the owner 
give the tenth penny in the Church for God , after that leave them to 
am end ; do this thrice ."-- _Lacnunga_, 79. 

"To preserve swine from sudden death sing over them four mass es, drive 
the swine to the fold, hang the worts upon the four sides and upon the 
door , also burn them, add ing incense and make the reek stream over the 
swine ."-- _Lacnunga_, 82.

Herb s used as amulets have always played a conspicuous part in folk 
medicine, and our Saxon ancestors used them, as all ancient races have 
used them, not merely to cure definite disease s but also as protection 
against the unseen powers of evil ,[27] to preserve the eye sight, to 
cure lunacy, against we ari ness when go ing on a journey, against being 
barked at by dog s, for safety from robber s, and in one prescription 
even to restore a woman stricken with speech less ness . The use of herbs 
as amulets to cure disease s has almost died out in this country , but 
the use of them as charms to en sure good luck surviv es to this 
day -- notably in the case of white heath er and four -leaved cl over . 

There is occasional ly the instruction to bind on the herb with red 
wool. For instance, a prescription against head ache in the third book 
of the _Leech Book_ enjoins bind ing waybroad , which has been dug up 
without iron before sun rise, round the head " with a red fil let ." 
Bind ing on with red wool is a very ancient and widespread custom .[28] 
Red was the colour sacred to T hor and it was also the colour ab hor red 
not only by witches in particular but by all the powers of darkness 
and evil . An ancient Assyrian eye charm pre scribe s bind ing "pure 
stra nds of red wool which have been brought by the pure hand of ... on 
the right hand ," and down to quite recent times even in these islands 
ty ing on with red wool was a common custom . 

Be sides their use as amulets , we also find instruction s for hang ing 
herbs up over door s, etc., for the benefit not only of human being s 
but of cattle also . Of mugwort we read in the _Herbarium of Apuleius_ , 
"And if a root of this wort be hung over the door of any house then 
may not any man damage the house ." 

" Of Crot on oil plant . For hail and rough we a ther to turn 
them away . If thou hast in thy possess ion this wort which is 
named 'ricinus' and which is not a native of England , if 
thou hang est some seed of it in thine house or have it or 
its seed in any place what soever , it turn eth away the 
tempestuous ness of hail , and if thou hang est its seed on a 
ship , to that degree wonderful it is , that it smootheth 
every tempest. This wort thou shalt take say ing thus, 'Wort 
ricinus I pray that thou be at my songs and that thou turn 
away hail s and light ning bolt s and all tempests through the 
name of Al mighty God who hight thee to be produced ' ; and 
thou shalt be clean when thou pluck est this herb ."--_Herb. 
Ap._, 176. 

" Against temp tation of the fi end , a wort hight red niolin, 
red stalk , it waxeth by running water ; if thou hast it on 
thee and under thy head and bolster and over thy house door 
the devil may not sca the thee with in nor without ."-- _Leech 
Book_, III. 58. 

"To preserve swine from sudden death take the worts lupin, 
bishopwort , hassuck grass, tufty thorn , viper s bugloss , 
drive the swine to the fold, hang the worts upon the four 
sides and upon the door ."-- _Lacnunga_, 82. 

The herbs in common est use as amulets were betony , vervain, peony, 
yarrow, mugwort and waybroad (plantain ). With the exception of 
vervain, no herb was more high ly prized than betony . The treatise on 
it in the _Herbarium of Apuleius_ is supposed to be an abridged copy 
of a treatise on the virtues of this plant written by Antonius Musa, 
physician to the Emper or Augustus. No few er than twenty- nine uses of 
it are given , and in the Saxon translation this herb is described as 
being " good whether for a man's soul or his body ." Verva in was one of 
the herbs held most sacred by the Druids and , as the herbals of Gerard 
and Parkinson testify, it was in high repute even as late as the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . It has never been satisfactori ly 
identified, though many authorities in cline to the belief that it was 
verbena. In Druidical times libat ions of honey had to be of fer ed to 
the earth from which it was dug , mystic ceremonies attended the 
digging of it and the plant was lifted out with the left hand . This 
uprooting had always to be performed at the r is ing of the dog star and 
when neither the sun nor the moon was shining. Why the humble waybroad 
should occupy so pro minent a place in Saxon herb lore it is difficult 
to understand . It is one of the nine sacred herbs in the alliterative 
lay in the _Lacnunga_, and the epithets " mother of worts " and " open 
from east wards " are applied to it . The latter curious epithet is also 
applied to it in _Lacnunga_ 46, --" which spreadeth open to wards the 
East ." Waybroad has certain ly wonderful ly curative powers , especially 
for be e-st ing s, but other wise it has long since fall en from its high 
estate. Peony through out the Middle Ages was held in high repute for 
its pro tect ive powers , and even during the closing years of the last 
century country folk hung be ad s made of its root s round child ren 's 
necks.[29] Yarrow is one of the ab original English plants , and from 
time immemorial it has been used in incantation s and by witches . 
Coun try folk still regard it as one of our most valuable herbs, 
especially for rheumatism. Mug wort, which was held in repute 
through out the Middle Ages for its efficacy against unseen powers of 
evil , is one of the nine sacred herbs in the alliterative lay in the 
_Lacnunga_, where it is described thus:-- 

"Eldest of worts 
Thou hast might for three 
And against thirty 
For venom availest 
For flying vile things , 
Mighty against loathed one s 
That through the land rove ." 

Harleian MS. 585 . 

[Illustration: (1) ARTEMISIA AND (2) BLACKBERRY, FROM A SAXON HERBAL 
(Sloane 1975, folio 37_a_)] 

With the not able exception of vervain, it is curious how little 
pro minence is given in Saxon plant lore to the herbs which were held 
most sacred by the Druids , and yet it is scarcely c red ible that some 
of their wonderful lore should not have been assimilated. But in these 
manuscripts little or no importance attaches to mistletoe, holly, 
birch or ivy . There is no mention of mistletoe as a sacred herb .[30] 
We find some mention of selago, generally identified with 
_lycopodium selago _, of which Pliny tells us vague ly that it was " like 
sav in ." The gather ing of it had to be accomp anied in Druid days with 
mystic ceremonies . The Druid had his feet b are and was clad in white , 
and the plant could not be cut with iron , nor touch ed with the naked 
hand . So great were its powers that it was called " the gift of God ." 
Nor is there any mention in Saxon plant lore of the use of _sorbus 
aucuparia _, which the Druids plant ed near their monolithic circle s as 
protection against unseen powers of darkness . There is , however, one 
prescription which may date back to the Roman occupation of Britain. 
It runs thus: "Take nettle s, and see the them in oil , smear and rub all 
thy body there with ; the cold will de part away ." [31] It has always been 
believed that one of the varieties of nettle (_Urtica pilulifera_) was 
introduced into England by the Roman soldier s, who brought the seed of 
it with them. According to the tradition, they were told that the cold 
in England was unendurable; so they brought these seed s in order to 
have a plentiful supp ly of nettle s where with to rub their bodies and 
there by keep themselves warm . Possib ly this prescription dates back to 
that time . 

From what hoary antiquity the charms and incantation s which we find in 
these manuscripts have come down to us we cannot say . Their atmosphere 
is that of palæolithic cave-d raw ing s, for they are redolent of the 
craft of sorcerers and they suggest those st range cave mark ing s which 
no one can deciphe r. Who can say what lost language s are embedded in 
these unintelligible words and sing le letters , or what is their 
meaning ? To what ancient ceremonies do they pertain, and who were the 
initiated who alone under stood them ? At present it is all mysterious , 
though perhaps one day we shall discover both their source s and their 
meaning . They show no definite traces of the Scandinavian rune-lays 
concerning herbs, though one of the charms is in runic character s. It 
is noteworthy that in the third book , which is evident ly much older 
than the first two parts of the _Leech Book_, the prop or tion of 
heathen charms is except ionally large . In one prescription we find the 
names of two heathen idol s, Tiec on and Leleloth, combined with a later 
Christian in terpola tion of the names of the four gospellers. The charm 
is in runic character s and is to be followed by a prayer . Many of the 
mystic sent en ces are who l ly in comprehensible, in others we find 
heathen names such as Lilumenne, in others a st ring of words which may 
be a corrupt form of some very ancient language . Thus a lay to be sung 
in case a man or beast drink s an in sect runs thus:-- "Go nomil, orgomil, 
marbumil, marbsai, t of eth ," etc. [32] 

If some of the charms have a malignant sound , others were probably as 
sooth ing in those days as those gems are still which have survived in 
our inimitable nursery rhymes. 

For instance, the following has for us no meaning , but even in the 
translation it has something of the curious effect of the words in the 
original . A woman who cannot rear her child is instructed to 
say --" E very where I carried for me the famous kind red doughty one with 
this famous meat doughty one , so I will have it for me and go home ." 

In the _Lacnunga_ there is a counting- out charm which is a mixture of 
an ancient heathen charm combined with a Christian rite at the end . 

"Nine were No d des sister s, then the nine came to be eight , 
and the eight seven, and the s even six, and the six five , 
and the five four , and the four three , and the three two , 
and the two one , and the one none . This may be medicine for 
thee from scrofula and from worm and from every mischief. 
Sing also the Benedicite nine times ."-- _Lacnunga_, 95.[33] 

One of the most remarkable narrat ive charms is that for war ts copied 
be low from the _Lacnunga_ . It is to be sung first into the left ear, 
then into the right ear, then above the man's poll, then " let one who 
is a maiden go to him and hang it upon his neck, do so for three days , 
it will soon be well with him ." 

" Here came enter ing 
A spider wight. 
He had his hands upon his ham s. 
He quoth that thou his hackney we rt. 
Lay thee against his neck. 
They beg an to sail off the land . 
As soon as they off the land came , then beg an they to cool. 
Then came in a wild beast 's sister . 
Then she ended 
And oaths she swore that never could this harm the sick , nor him 
who could get at this charm , nor him who had skill to sing this 
charm . Amen. Fiat ."-- _Lacnunga_, 56 . 

Of the world-wide custom of charm ing disease from the patient and 
transfer ring it to some inanimate object we find numerous example s. 
This custom is not only of very ancient origin , but persisted until 
recent times even in this country . As commonly practised in 
out -of-the- way parts of Great Brita in it was believed that the disease 
transfer red to an inanimate object would be contracted by the next 
person who picked it up, but in the Saxon herbals we find an 
apparently older custom of transfer ring the disease to " running water " 
( suggest ive of the Israelitish scapegoat ), and also that of throw ing 
the blood from the wound a cross the wagon way . These charms for 
transfer ring disease seem original ly to have been associate d with a 
considerable amount of ceremonial. For instance, in those to cure the 
bite of a hunting spider we find that a certain number of 
scarifications are to be struck ( and in both cases an odd 
number -- three and five ) ; in the case of the five scarifications , " one 
on the bite and four round about it ," the blood is to be caught in " a 
green spo on of hazel- wood ," and the blood is to be thrown " in silence " 
over a wagon way . In the _Lacnunga_ there are traces of the actual 
ceremonial of transfer ring the disease , and the Christian prayer has 
obviously been substituted for an older heathen one . The charm is in 
unintelligible words and is followed by the instruction , " Sing this 
nine times and the Pater Noster nine times over a barley loaf and give 
it to the horse to eat ." In a " salve against the elf in race" it is 
not ice able that the herbs, after elabo rate pre parat ion, are not 
administe red to the patient at all , but are thrown into running water . 

"A salve against the elf in race and nocturnal gobl in 
visitors : take wormwood , l up in .... Put these worts into a 
vessel, set them under the altar , sing over them nine 
mass es, boil them in butter and sheep 's grease, add much 
holy salt , stra in through a cloth , throw the worts into 
running water ."-- _Leech Book_, III. 61. 

One charm in the _Lacnunga_ which is perhaps not too long to quote 
speaks of some long - lost tale. It appear s to be a frag ment of a 
popular lay , and one wonders how many count less generations of our 
ancestors sang it , and what it comm emorates :-- 

"Loud were they loud, as over the land they rode , 
Fierce of heart were they , as over the hill they rode . 
Shield thee now thyself ; from this spite thou mayst escape the e! 
Out little spear if here in thou be! 
Under neath the linden stood he , under neath the sh in ing shield, 
While the mighty women must e red up their strength; 
And the spear s they send scream ing through the air! 
Back again to them will I send another . 
Arrow forth a- flying from the front against them ; 
Out little spear if here in thou be! 
Sat the smith there at , smoke a little seax out . 
Out little spear if here in thou be! 
Six the smith s that s at there -- making slaughter- spear s : 
Out little spear , in be not spear ! 
If here in there hide flake of iron hard , 
Of a witch the work , it shall melt away . 
Wert thou shot into the skin , or shot into the flesh , 
Wert thou shot into the blood , or shot into the b one , 
Wert thou shot into the limb -- never more thy life be teased! 
If it were the shot of Esa, or it were of elves the shot 
Or it were of hags the shot ; help I bring to the e. 
This to boot for Esa-shot, this to boot for elf in -shot. 
This to boot for shot of hags ! Help I bring to the e. 
Flee witch to the wild hill top ... ... 
But thou -- be thou hale, and help thee the Lord ." 

Who were these six smith s and who were the witches ? One think s of that 
mighty Smith We yl and in the palace of Nidad k ing of the Niar s, of the 
queen 's fear of his flash ing eyes and the ma im ing of him by her cruel 
order s, and of the cups he made from the skulls of her sons and gems 
from their eyes . We think of these as old tales, but in stinct tells us 
that they are hor rib ly real . We may not know how that semi-divine 
smith made himself wing s, but that he flew over the palace and never 
returned we do not doubt for an in stant. To the fair y stories which 
em body such myth s child ren of unnum be red generations have list en ed , 
and they de m and them over and over again because they , too , are sure 
that they are real . 

Nor is the mystery of number s lacking in these herbal prescriptions , 
particular ly the number s three and nine . In the alliterative lay of 
the nine heal ing herbs this is very conspicuous . Woden , we are told , 
smote the serpent with nine magic twigs , the serpent was broken into 
nine parts , from which the wind blew the nine flying venom s. There are 
numerous instances of the patient being direct ed to take nine of each 
of the ing red ients or to take the herb pot ion itself for three or nine 
days . Or it is direct ed that an incantation is to be said or sung 
three or nine times , or that three or nine mass es are to be sung over 
the herbs. This mystic use of three and nine is conspicuous in the 
following prescription :-- 

" Against dysentery, a bramble of which both ends are in the 
earth take the new er root , delve it up, cut up nine chips 
with the left hand and sing three times the Miserere mei 
Deus and nine times the Pater Noster , then take mugwort and 
ever last ing, boil these three worts and the chips in milk 
till they get red , then let the man sip at night fast ing a 
pound dish full ... let him rest himself s oft and wrap 
himself up warm ; if more need be let him do so again , if 
thou still need do it a third time , thou wilt not need 
of tener ."-- _Leech Book_, II. 65. 

The leech dom for the use of dwarf elder against a snake - bite runs 
thus:-- [34] 

"For rent by snake take this wort and ere thou carve it off 
hold it in thine hand and say thrice nine times Omnes malas 
be stias can to , that is in our language Enchant and over come 
all evil wild deer; then carve it off with a very sharp 
knife into three parts ."--_Herb. Ap._, 93. 

Some of the most remarkable passages in the manuscripts are those 
concerning the ceremonies to be observed both in the picking and in 
the administering of herbs. What the mystery of plant life which has 
so deeply affected the minds of men in all ages and of all 
civilisations meant to our ancestors , we can but dim ly appreh end as we 
study these ceremonies . They carry us back to that worship of earth 
and the forces of Nature which pre vailed when Woden was yet unborn. 
That Woden was the chief god of the tribes on the mainland is 
in disputable, but even in the hierarchy of ancestors reverence d as 
semi-divine the Saxon s themselves look ed to Sceaf rather than to 
Woden , who himself was des c ended from Sceaf . There are few more 
haunt ing legend s than that of our mystic for efather, the little boy 
a sleep on a sheaf of corn who , in a rich ly adorned vessel which moved 
neither by sail s nor oar s, came to our people out of the great deep 
and was hail ed by them as their king. Did not Alf red himself claim him 
as his primeval pro genitor, the found er of our race ? There is no 
tang ible link between his descendant Woden and the worship of earth , 
but the sheaf of corn , the symbol of Sceaf , carries us stra ight back 
to Nature worship . Sceaf take s his fitt ing place as the semi-divine 
ancestor with the less er divinities such as Hrede and Eostra, goddess 
of the radiant dawn . It is to this age that the ceremonies in the 
picking of the herbs transport us , to the mystery of the virtues of 
herbs, the fertility of earth , the never -cea sing conflict between the 
beneficent forces of sun and summer and the evil powers of the long , 
dark nor the rn wint ers . Closely in tertwined with Nature worship we find 
the later Christian rites and ceremonies . For the new teach ing did not 
oust the old , and for many centuries the mind of the aver age man 
halted half- way between the two faiths. If he accepted Christ he did 
not cease to fear the great hierarchy of unseen powers of Nature , the 
worship of which was b red in his very bone. The ancient festival s of 
Yule and Eo stra continued under another guise and polytheism still 
held its s way . The devil became one with the gloom y and terrible in 
Nature , with the malignant elves and dwarf s. Even with the war far e 
between the beneficent powers of sun and the fertility of Nature and 
the malignant powers of wint er, the devil became associate d . Nor did 
men cease to believe in the Wyrd, that dark , ultimate fate goddess 
who , though obscure, lies at the back of all Saxon belief . It was in 
va in that the Church preached against superstitions . Egbert, 
Archbishop of York, in his Penitential, strict ly forbade the gather ing 
of herbs with incantation s and enjoined the use of Christian rites , 
but it is probable that even when these manuscripts were written , the 
majority at least of the common folk in these islands , though 
nominal ly Christian , had not des erted their ancient way s of 
though t.[35] When the Saxon peasant went to gather his heal ing herbs 
he may have used Christian pray ers[36] and ceremonies , but he did not 
forget the goddess of the dawn . It is noteworthy how frequent ly we 
find the in junc tion that the herbs must be picked at sun rise or when 
day and night divide, how of ten stress is laid upon look ing to wards 
the east , and turn ing " as the sun go eth from east to south and west ." 
In many there is the instruction that the herb is to be gathered 
" without use of iron " or " with gold and with hart 's horn " (emblems of 
the sun 's rays ). It is curious how little there is of moon lore . In 
some cases the herbs are to be gathered in silence , in others the man 
who gather s them is not to look behind him -- a pro hibi tion which occurs 
frequent ly in ancient superstitions . The ceremonies are all mysterious 
and suggest ive , but behind them always lies the ancient in eradic able 
worship of Nature . To what dim past does that cry, " Erce, Erce, Erce, 
Mother of Earth " carry us ? 

" Erce, Erce, Erce, Mother of Earth ! 
May the All -Wi elder , Ever Lord grant thee 
Acres a-wax ing, up wards a-growing 
Pregnant [ with corn ] and plenteous in strength; 
Hosts of [grain] shafts and of glittering plants ! 
Of broad barley the blossom s 
And of white wheat ears wax ing, 
Of the whole earth the harvest! 
Let be guard ed the gra in against all the ill s 
That are s own o'er the land by the sorcery men, 
Nor let cunning women change it nor a craft y man ." 

And that other ancient verse :-- 

"Hail be thou , Earth , Mother of men ! 
In the lap of the God be thou a-growing ! 
Be fil led with fodder for far e- need of men ! " 

It is of these two invocations that Stopford Brooke ( whose 
translation s I have used ) writes: " These are very old heathen 
invocations used , I daresay, from century to century and from far 
pre his to ric times by all the Teuton ic far mer s. Who 'Erce' is remains 
obscure. But the Mother of Earth seems to be here meant , and she is a 
person who great ly kind les our curiosity. To touch her is like 
touch ing empty space , so far away is she . At any rate some God head or 
other seems here set forth under her proper name . In the Nor the rn 
Cosmogony, N ight is the Mother of Earth . But Erce cannot be N ight . She 
is ( if Erce be a proper name ) bound up with agriculture. Grimm 
suggest s Eorce, connected with the Old High German 'erchan' = simple x. 
He also make s a bold guess that she may be the same as a divine dame 
in Low Saxon districts called He rke or Harke, who dispenses earth ly 
good s in abundance, and act s in the same way as Berhta and Holda--an 
earth- goddess , the lady of the ploug her and sower and reap er. In the 
Mark she is called Frau Harke. Montanus draw s at ten tion to the 
appearance of this charm in a convent at Corvei, in which this line 
begin s--'Eostar, Eostar, eordhan modor.' ... The name remains 
mysterious . The song breath es the pleasure and worship of ancient 
till ers of the s oil in the labour s of the earth and in the good s the 
mother gave. It has grown , it seems , out of the br east of earth 
her self; earth is here the Mother of Men. The surface of earth is the 
lap of the God des s; in her womb let all growth be plentiful . Food is 
in her for the need s of men . 'Hail be thou , Earth ! ' I d are say this 
hymn was sung ten thousand years ago by the early Aryans on the Baltic 
coast ." 

Even in a twelfth- century herbal we find a prayer to Earth , and it is 
so beautiful that I close this chapter with it :-- 

"Earth,[37] divine goddess , Mother Nature who generatest all 
things and bring est forth a new the sun which thou hast given 
to the nations ; Guardian of sky and sea and of all gods and 
powers and through thy power all nature fall s silent and 
then sinks in sleep . And again thou bring est back the light 
and chase st away night and yet again thou cove rest us most 
secure ly with thy shades. Thou dost contain chaos in finite, 
ye a and wind s and show ers and storms ; thou send est them out 
when thou wilt and causest the seas to roar; thou chase st 
away the sun and arousest the storm. Again when thou wilt 
thou send est forth the joyous day and give st the nourish ment 
of life with thy eternal sure ty ; and when the soul de parts 
to thee we return. Thou in deed art du ly called great Mother 
of the gods ; thou conque rest by thy divine name . Thou art 
the source of the strength of nations and of gods , without 
thee nothing can be brought to perfect ion or be born; thou 
art great queen of the gods . God des s ! I adore thee as 
divine ; I call upon thy name ; be pleased to grant that which 
I ask thee, so shall I give thanks to thee, goddess , with 
one faith. 

"H ear, I beseech thee, and be favour able to my prayer . 
What soever herb thy power dost pro duce, give , I pray , with 
good will to all nations to save them and grant me this my 
medicine . Come to me with thy powers , and how soever I may 
use them may they have good success and to whom soever I may 
give them. What ever thou dost grant it may pro sp er. To thee 
all things return. Those who right ly rece ive these herbs 
from me, do thou make them whole . God des s, I beseech the e; 
I pray thee as a supp liant that by thy majesty thou grant 
this to me . 

" Now I make in tercess ion to you all ye powers and herbs and 
to your majesty , ye whom Earth pa rent of all hath produced 
and given as a medicine of health to all nations and hath 
put majesty upon you , be , I pray you , the greatest help to 
the human race . This I pray and beseech from you , and be 
present here with your virtues , for she who created you hath 
her s elf promised that I may gather you into the good will of 
him on whom the art of medicine was be stowed, and grant for 
health 's sake good medicine by grace of your powers . I pray 
grant me through your virtues that what soe'er is wrought by 
me through you may in all its powers have a good and speedy 
effect and good success and that I may always be permitted 
with the favour of your majesty to gather you into my hands 
and to gle an your fruits. So shall I give thanks to you in 
the name of that majesty which ordained your birth ."

wolf's teazle in the _Herbarium of Apuleius_ :-- "This wort hath leaves 
reversed and thorn y and it hath in its midst a round and thorn y knob, 
and that is brown-headed in the blossom s and hath white seed and a 
white and very fragrant root ." The word "reversed" is not in the 
original and was therefore added by the Saxon translator, who had 
observed the fact that all the thistle tri be pro tect their leaves by 
thorn s point ing back wards as well as for wards . 

[7] It is interesting to remembe r that even as late as the sixteenth 
century plant a in was called " waybroad ." See _ Turner's Herbal_ . 

[8] There are numerous Latin MSS. of this book , chief ly in Italian 
libraries , several being in the Laurentian Library at Florence. The 
book was first printed at Rome, probably soon after 1480, by Joh. 
Philippus de Lignamine, who was also the editor. De Lignamine, who was 
physician to Pope Six tus IV., says that he found this MS. in the 
library of the monastery of Monte Cassino. In the first impression the 
book is dedicated to Cardinal de Gonzaga; in the second impression to 
Cardinal de Ruvere. ( The copy in the British Museum is of the second 
impression . ) In this small quarto volume the illustrations are rough 
cuts . It is interesting to remembe r that these are the earliest known 
printed figures of plants . The printed text contain s a large number of 
Greek and Latin synonyms which do not appear in the Saxon translation . 
Sub sequent editions were printed in 152 8 (Paris) and in the Aldine 
Collec tion of Latin medical writer s, 1547 (Venice).

It is at least probable that Wanley , who at this period was collect ing 
Anglo-Saxon manuscripts for George Hicke s, secure d this MS. from 
" barbara crokker." Her naïve avowal of her in ability to read the MS. 
suggest s that she probably had no idea of the value of the book , and 
when one remembe rs Wanley 's reputation for driving shrewd bargains one 
cannot help wondering what he paid for this treasure . Those must have 
been halcy on days for collect or s, when a man who had been an assistant 
in the Bodleian Library with a salary of £12 a year could buy Saxon 
manuscripts !

[22] The direct ions for the vapour bath are given in such a brief and 
yet for ce ful way that I cannot imagine any one read ing it without 
feel ing at the end as though he had run breath less ly to collect the 
herbs, and then prepared the bath and final ly made the ley of alder 
ashes to wash the unfortunate patient 's head . Like all these cheer ful 
Saxon prescriptions , this one ends with the comfort ing assu rance " it 
will soon be well with him ," and one wonders whether in this , as in 
many other cases , the patient got well in order to avoid his friend s ' 
ministrations. The prescription for a vapour bath made with herbs runs 
thus:-- 

"Take bramble rind and elm rind , a sh rind , sloe thorn , rind of apple 
tree and ivy , all these from the nether part of the trees, and 
cucumber, smear wort, ever fern , helenium , enchant ers night shade , 
betony , marrubium, radish , agrimony. Scrape the worts into a kettle 
and boil strong ly . When it hath strong ly boil ed remove it off the fire 
and seat the man over it and wrap the man up that the vapour may get 
up no where , except only that the man may breath e; be a the him with 
these foment at ions as long as he can bear it . Then have another bath 
ready for him , take an emmet bed all at once , a bed of those male 
emmet s which at while s fly, they are red one s, boil them in water , 
be a the him with it immode rate ly hot . Then make him a salve . Take worts 
of each kind of those above mentioned , boil them in butter , smear the 
sore limb s, they will soon quick en . Make him a ley of alder ashes , 
wash his head with this cold , it will soon be well with him , and let 
the man get bl ed every month when the moon is five and fifteen and 
twenty nights old ."

[26] _A Pomeranian R it e._ --An attempt was made a few days ago to cast 
a devil out of a woman living in a village of the Lauenberg di strict 
of Pomerania, on the Polish front ier . She appear s to have been of a 
s our and somewhat hysterical temperament , and three of the village 
gossips came to the conclusion that she was a victim of diabolical 
possess ion and resolved to effect a cure by mean s of enchantment. They 
first of all gathered the herbs need ed for the purpose in the forest 
at the proper con junc tion of the stars . Then a tripod was formed of 
three chair s, and to these the patient was bound . Be neath her was 
fixed a pail of red - hot coal on which the herbs were scattered . As the 
fumes of the burn ing weeds veiled the victim the three neighbours 
crooned the prescribed exorcism. The louder the woman shrieked the 
louder they sang , and after the pro ces s had been continued long enough 
to prove effect ive , in their opinion , they ran away , be lie v ing that 
the devil would run out of the woman after them. She , however, 
continued to shriek. Her cries were hear d by a man , who released 
her . --_The Times_ , December 5 , 192 1. 

[27] It is interesting to find the same beliefs amongst the ancient 
Babylonia ns .

[30] Even modern science has not yet succeeded in solv ing some of the 
my steries connected with this remarkable plant . For instance, although 
the apple and the pear are closely related, mistletoe very rarely 
grows on the pear tree, and there is no case on record of mistletoe 
plant ed on a pear tree by human hands surviv ing the st age of 
germinat ion. There are , it is true , two famous mistletoe pear s in this 
country -- one in the garden of Belvoir Castle and the other in the 
garden of Fern Lodge, Malvern, but in both cases the seed was s own 
natural ly . It grows very rarely on the oak, and this possibly account s 
for the special reverence accorded by the Druids to the mistletoe oak.

[33] This closely resembles a Cornish charm for a tett er. 

"Tetter, tetter, thou hast nine broth ers,

Thus the verses are continued until tett er having " no br other " is

[35] St. Eloy, in a sermon preached in A.D. 64 0, also forbade the 
enchant ing of herbs :-- 

" Be fore all things I declare and testify to you that you shall observe 
none of the impious custom s of the pagan s, neither sorcerers , nor 
divine rs , nor sooth say ers, nor enchant ers, nor must you presume for 
any cause to enquire of them .... Let none regulate the beginning of 
any piece of work by the day or by the moon . Let none trust in nor 
presume to in voke the names of dæm on s, neither Neptune, nor Or cu s, nor 
Diana, nor Minerva, nor Geniscus nor any other such follies. ... Let no 
Christian place light s at the temp les or the stones , or at founta in s, 
or at trees, or at places where three way s meet .... Let none presume 
to hang amulets on the neck of man or beast .... Let no one presume to 
make lu stra tion s, nor to enchant herbs, nor to make flocks pass 
through a hol low tree, or an aperture in the earth ; for by so do ing he 
seems to consecrate them to the devil . Let none on the kalends of 
January join in the wicked and ridiculous things , the dres sing like 
old women or like stag s, nor make feasts last ing all night , nor keep 
up the custom of gift s and in temp e rate drink ing . Let no one on the 
festival of St. John or on any of the festival s join in the solstitia 
or dances or leap ing or caraulas or diabolical songs ."-- From a sermon 
preached by St. Eloy in A.D. 64 0. 

[36] A Christian prayer for a bless ing on herbs runs thus:-- 

"Omnipotens sempiterne de us qui ab in it io mundi omnia in stituisti et 
creasti tam arborum generibus qu am herb arum seminibus quibus etiam

CHAPTER II 

LATER MANUSCRIPT HERBALS AND THE EARLY PRINTED HERBALS 

"Spryngynge tyme is the time of glad nesse and of love ; for 
in Spryng ing time all thynge semeth glad de ; for the er the

Spryng yng time ."-- BARTHOLOMÆUS ANGLICUS , _circ._ 12 60. 


Between the Anglo-Saxon herbals and the early printed herbals there is 
a great gulf. After the Nor man C on quest the old Anglo-Saxon lore 
natural ly fell into disrepute, although the Nor man s were inferior to 
the Saxon s in their knowledge of herbs. The learned books of the 
conque rors were written exclus ive ly in Latin , and it is s ad to think 
of the number of beautiful Saxon books which must have been destroy ed , 
for when the Saxon s were turned out of their own mona steries the 
Nor man s who sup plant ed them probably regarded books written in a 
language they did not understand as mere rub bish. Much of the old 
Saxon herb lore is to be found in the leech books of the Middle Ages , 
but , with one not able exception , no important original treatise on 
herbs by an English writer has come down to us from that period . The 
vast majority of the herbal MSS. are merely trans cript ions of Macer's 
herbal, a mediæval Latin poem on the virtues of s even ty-s even plants , 
which is believed to have been written in the tenth century . The 
popular ity of this poem is shown by the number of MSS. still extant. 
It was translated into English as early as the twelfth century with 
the addition of "A fewe herbes wyche Macer tretyth not ." [38] In 1373 
it was translated by John Lelamoure, a school master of Her tford. On 
folio 5 5 of the MS. of this translation is the in scription , " God 
gra cious of graunt is hav y the yyeue and ygrauted vertuys in wood ys 
stonys and herbes of the whiche erb is Macer the philosofure made a 
boke in Latyne the whiche boke Johannes Lelamoure scolemaistre of 
Her for de est , they he un worthy was in the yere of oure Lorde a . m . 
ccc. lxxiij to urnyd in to Yngl is ." Macer's herbal is also the b as is of 
a treatise in rhyme of which there are several copies in England and 
one in the Royal Library at Stockholm. This treatise , which deal s with 
twenty- four herbs, begins th us quaint ly -- 

" Of erb s xxiiij I woll you tell by and by 
Al s I fond wryten in a boke at I in boro yng toke 
Of a gret lady s pre ste of gret name she b a rest ." 

The poem begins with a description of betony , power ful against "wykked 
speryti s," and then treat s, amongst other herbs, of the virtues of 
centaury, marig old , celandine, pimpernel, mother wort, vervain, 
periwinkle , rose , lily , henbane, agrimony, s age , rue, fennel and 
violet. It is pleasant to find the belief that only to look on 
marig old s will draw evil humour s out of the head and strength en the 
eyes ight . 

"Go lde [marigold] is bitter in savour 
Fayr and ȝelw [yellow] is his flowur 
Ye golde flour is good to sene 
It makyth ye syth bryth and cl ene 
Wysce ly to lokyn on his flowr is 
Dra wyth owt of ye heed wikked hirores [humours]. 
. . . . . . . 
Loke wysce ly on golde er ly at mor we [morning] 
Yat day fro feueres it sch all ye bor we : 
Ye odour of ye golde is good to smelle ." 

The instruction s for the picking of this joyous flower are given at 
length. It must be taken only when the moon is in the sign of the 
Virgin, and not when Jupiter is in the ascendant, for then the herb 
lose s its virtue. And the gather er, who must be out of deadly sin, 
must say three Pater Noster s and three Aves. Amongst its many virtues 
we find that it gives the we are r a visi on of any one who has robbed 
him. The virtues of vervain also are many ; it must be picked " at 
Sp ring of day " in " ye monyth of May ." Periwinkle is given its 
beautiful old name " joy of the ground " (" men calle it ye Juy of 
Grownde") and the description runs thus:-- 

"Parwynke is an er be grene of colour 
In tyme of May he be ryth blo flour , 
His stalk ys a in [are] so feynt [weak] and fe ye 
Yet never more growyth he he ye [high] ." 

Under s age we find the old prove rb --" How can a man die who has s age in 
his garden ? " 

" Why of seknesse deyeth man 
W hill saw ge [sage] in gardeyn he may han ." 

A manuscript of exception al interest is one describing the virtues of 
rosemary which was sent by the Countess of Hainault to her daughter 
Philippa , Queen of England , and a part from its intrinsic interest it 
is important from the fact that it is obviously the original of the 
very poe tical discourse on rosemary in the first printed English 
herbal, commonly known as Banckes 's herbal . Moreover, in this MS. 
there is record ed an old tradition which I have not found in any other 
herbal, but which is still cur rent amongst old -fashioned country folk , 
namely, that rosemary "passeth not commonly in hight e the hight e of 
Criste w hill he was man on Er the ," and that when the plant attains the 
age of thirty - three years it will increase in breadth but not in 
he ight . It is the oldest MS. in which we find many other beliefs about 
rosemary that still surviv e in England . There is a tradition that 
Queen Philippa 's mother sent the first plants of rosemary to England , 
and in a copy of this MS. in the library of Trinity College, 
Cambridge, the translator, "danyel b a in ," says that rosemary was 
unknown in England until the Countess of Hainault sent some to her 
daughter . 

The only original treatise on herbs written by an English man during 
the Middle Ages was that by Bartholomæus Anglicus, and on the 
plant -l over there are probably few of the mediæval writer s who 
exercise so pot ent a spell. Even in the thirteen th century , that age 
of great men, Bartholomew the English man ranked with think ers such as 
Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas and Albert us Magnus. He was account ed one 
of the greatest the ologians of his day, and if his lecture s on 
the ology were as simple as his writings on herbs, it is easy to 
understand why they were thr on ged and why his writings were so eager ly 
studied , not only in his life time but for nearly three centuries 
after wards . A child could understand his book on herbs, for , being 
great , he was simple . But although his work _De Proprietatibus Rerum_ 
( which contain s nine teen books ) was the source of common information 
on Natural Hi story through out the Middle Ages , and was one of the 
books hi red out at a regulate d price by the scholars of Paris , we know 
very little of the writer . He spent the greater part of his life in 
France and Saxon y, but he was English born and was always known as 
Bartholomæus Anglicus.[39] We know that he studied in Paris and 
entered the French province of the Mino rite Ord er, and later he became 
one of the most renowned pro fessors of the ology in Paris . In 12 30 a 
letter was received from the general of the Friars Mino r in the new 
province of Saxon y asking the pro vincial of France to send Bartholomew 
and another English man to help in the work of that province , and the 
former subsequently went there . We do not know the exact date of _De 
Proprietatibus Rerum_ , but it must have been written about the middle 
of the thirteen th century ; for , though it cites Albert us Magnu s, who 
was teach ing in Paris in 12 48 , there is no mention of any of the later 
authorities , such as Thomas Aquinas , Roger Ba con and Vincent de 
Beauva is . It was certain ly known in England as early as 12 96, for 
there is a copy of that date at Oxford, and there still exist both in 
France and in England a considerable number of other manuscript 
copies , most of which date from the latter part of the thirteen th 
century and the early part of the four teen th . The book was translated 
into English in 13 98 by John de Trevisa,[40] chaplain to Lord Berkeley 
and vicar of Berkeley , and Bartholomew could scarcely have been more 
for tunate in his translator . At the end of his translation , Trevisa 
writes thus:-- 

"Endlesse grace blysse than kyng and pray s yng unto our Lorde 
God Omnipotent be gyuen, by who os ayde and helpe this 
trans la con was end yd at Berkeley e the syxte day e of Feuerer 
the yere of our Lorde MCCCLXXXXVI II the yere of y{e} reyne 
of Kynge Rycharde the second e after the Conqueste of 
Englonde X XII. The yere of my lord es aege, syre Thomas , 
Lorde of Berkeley e that made me to make this Translacōn 
XLV II. " 

Salimbene show s that the book was known in Italy in 128 3, and there 
are two MS. copies in the Bibliothèque National e of Paris , of which 
the earliest is date d 12 9 7. Be fore Trevisa made his English 
translation , it had been translated into French by Jehan Corbichon, in 
13 72, for Charles V . of France . 

The book was first printed at Basle about 147 0, and the est eem in 
which it was held may be judge d from the fact that it went through at 
least four teen editions before 150 0, and be sides the English and 
French translation s it was also translated into Spanish and Dutch. The 
English translation was first printed by Caxton 's famous apprentice, 
Wynken de Worde.[41] The translator in a naïve little in troductory 
poem says that , just as he had look ed as a child to God to help him in 
his game s, so now he pray s Hi m to help him in this book . 

"C[?]Rosse was made all of red . 
In the begynn ing of my boke . 
That is called , god me s ped . 
In the fyrste less on that j toke . 
Then ne I learned a and b . 
And other letters by her names . 
But al way God spede me . 
Thou ght me nedefull in all game s . 
Yf I played in felde, other me des . 
Stylle other wyth noyse . 
I pray ed help in all my de des . 
Of him that deyed upon the croys . 
Now dyuers e play es in his name . 
I shall lette pass e forth and far . 
And aventure to play so long game . 
Also I shall sp are . 
Wode s, me des and fel des . 
Place that I have played in ne . 
And in his name that all thīg wel des . 
This game j shall begynn e. . 
And pray e helpe con seyle and red e . 
To me that he wo lde s ende . 
And this game rule and le de . 
And brynge it to a good ende . ." 

And in the preface Trevisa add resses his read ers thus: "Merveyle not , 
ye wit ty and eloquent red ers, that I thȳne of wytte and voyde of 
cunning have trans latid this boke from latin to our vulgayre language 
as a thynge profit able to me and peradventure to many other , whych 
under stonde not latyn nor have not the knowledge of the prop rytees of 
thynges ." 

The seventeenth book of _De Proprietatibus Rerum_ is on herbs and 
their uses , and it is full of allusions to the classical writer s on 
herbs -- Aristotle, Dioscorides and Galen -- but the descriptions of the 
plants themselves are original and charm ing . 

There is no record to show that Bartholomew the English man was a 
garden er, but we can hard ly doubt that the man who described flowers 
with such loving care possess ed a garden and work ed in it . The 
_Herbarius zu Teutsch_ might have been written in a study , but there 
is fresh air and the beauty of the living flowers in Bartholomew 's 
writings . Of the lily he says: "The Lely is an herbe wyth a whyte 
floure . And though the levys of the floure be whyte yet wyth en shyneth 
the ly knesse of golde ." Bartholomew may have known nothing of the 
modern science of botany, but he knew how to describe not only the 
lily , but also the atmosphere of the lily , in a word - picture of 
inimitable simplicity and beauty . One feels instinctive ly that only a 
child or a great man could have written those lines . And is there not 
something unforgett able in these few words on the un f old ing of a 
rose --" And whāne they [ the petals ] ben full growen they sprede 
the ymselues ayenst the sonne rysynge"? 

The chapter on the rose is long er than most , and is so deli ghtful that 
I quote a considerable part of it . "The rose of gardens is plant ed and 
sette and tylthed as a vyne. And if it is for g end red and not sh red and 
pa red and not clensed of super fluyte : thēne it gooth out of kynde 
and chaungeth in to a wylde rose . And by oft chaung ing and tylth ing 
the wylde rose to rn eth and chaūgith into a very rose . And the rose 
of ye garden and the wylde rose ben dyuers in multitude of floures : 
smelle and colour : and also in vertue . For the leves of the wylde rose 
ben fewe and brode and why tyssh : meddlyd wyth lytyll red nesse : and 
smellyth not so wel as the tame rose , nother is so vertuous in 
medicyn. The tame rose hath many leuys sette nye to gyder : and ben all 
red , other almost white : w{t} wonder good smell .... And the more they 
ben br used and broken : the vertuoūser they ben and the better 
smell ynge . And springeth out of a thorn e that is harde and rough : 
netheles the Rose folo wyth not the kynde of the thorn e : But she 
aray eth her thorn wyth fayr colour and good smell . Whan ye rose 
begynn eth to sprynge it is close d in a knoppe wyth grene s : and that 
knoppe is grene . And whan̄e it swellyth then ne spryngeth out harde 
leuys and sharp e .... And whāne they ben full growen they sprede 
the ymselues ayenst the sonne rysynge. And for they ben tendre and 
feble to holde to gyder in the begynn ynge ; they fore about those smale 
grene leuys ben nyghe the red and tendre leuys ... and ben sette all 
about e. And in the my d ill thereof is seen the sede small and yellow 
wyth full gode smell ." 

[Illustration: WOODCUT OF TREES AND HERBS FROM THE SEVENTEENTH 
BOOK OF "DE PROPRIETATIBUS RERUM" 
Printed by Wynkyn de Worde (1495)] 

There follows a description , too long to quote here , of the growth of 
the rose hip, which ends with the remark : " But they ben not ful good 
to ete for rough nesse that is hyd wyth in . And greuyth [grieveth] 
wyth in his throte that ete thereof ." ... "A mong all floures of the 
worlde ," he continues, " the floure of the rose is cheyf and be e ryth ye

fayr nesse they fede the syghte : and play s eth the smelle by odour , the

Rose honey . " Rose shreede small e and so d in hony makyth that hony 
medycyn able wyth gode smelle : And this comfort ye th and clens eth and 
defy eth gle y my humour s ." 

Of the violet we read : "Vio let is a lytyll herbe in substaunce and is

smellyth moost .... And the more vertuous the floure thereof is , ye 
more it ben dyth the heed thereof doūwarde. Also floures of 
spryngynge tyme spryngeth fyrste and sheweth some r. The ly tylnes 
thereof in substaunce is no b ly rewarded in gret nesse of sauour and of 
vertue ." 

Bartholomew 's descriptions of flowers are usually brief , and there is 
a clarity and vivid ness about them which give them a charm peculiar ly 
their own . How fresh and English , for instance, is his chapter on the 
apple . I have never before seen the taste of an apple described as 
"merry ," but how true the description is ! "Malus the Appyll tree is a 
tree yt be r eth apple s and is a grete tree in itself ... it is more 
short than other trees of the wood wyth knottes and rinelyd Rynde. 
And makyth shadowe wyth e thy cke bowes and braunches : and fayr with 
dyuers blossom es, and floures of swet nesse and ly kyng e : with good e 
fruyte and noble. And is gra cious in syght and in taste and vertuous 
in medecyne ... some be ryth s our y sh fruyte and harde and some ryght 
s oure and some ryght swete , with a good savour e and mery ." The 
descriptions of celandine and broom are also characteristic . 
"Celidonia is an herbe w{t} yelowe floures , the frute smorch eth them 
that it to wchyth. And hyghte Celidonia for it spryngeth , other 
blo myth , in the comynge of swal owes .... It hyȝt celidonia for it 
help it h swallowes bir des yf their eye n be hurt e other (or) blynde ." 
"Genesta hath that name of bytter ness for it is full of bytter to 
man nes taste . And is a shrubbe that growyth in a place that is 
for s aken , stony and untylthed. Pre sence thereof is wyt nesse that the 
ground e is bareyne and drye that it groweth in . And hath many 
braunches knotty and hard . Grene in wynter and yelowe floures in some r 
thy che [ the which ] wrap ped with heuy smell and bitter sauour . And ben 
netheles moost of vertue ." Bartholomew gives the old mandrake legend 
in full , though he add s, " it is so feynd of churles others of 
wyt che s," and he also writes of its use as an anæsthetic.[42] Further, 
he records two other beliefs about the mandrake which I have never 
found in any other English herbal -- namely, that while uprooting it one 
must beware of contrary wind s, and that one must go on digging for it 
until sun set . " They that dygge mandragora be be sy to beware of 
contrary wyn des why le they dig ge . And make n circle s abowte with a 
swerder and abyde with the dyggynge unto the sonne go ynge down e." 

But a part from herbs and their uses , the book _De herb is _ is full of 
fleet ing yet vigorous pictures of the home ly everyday side of mediæval 
life . Bartholomew , being one of the greatest men of his century , 
writes of matter s in which the simple st of us are interest ed . He 
tells us of the feed ing of swine with acorns. Of the making and bak ing 
of bread ( including the thrifty custom of mix ing cooked be an s with the 
flour " to make the b red e the more hevy"). Incidentally, and with all 
due respect, it may be remark ed that he had no prac tical knowledge of 
this subject, his vivid description being obviously that of an 
interest ed spectator. There is an air y mascu line vague ness about the 
conclusion of the whole matter of bread - making --" and at last after 
many travaile s, man's lyfe is fedde and sustained there with ." He tells 
us of the use of laurel leaves to heal be e and was p st ing s and to keep 
books and cloth es from "moths and other worm s," of the making of 
"fayre image s " and of boxes where in to keep "spycery" from the wood of 
the box-tree. Of the making of trestle tables "area red and set upon 
feet ," of play ing boards " that men play e on at the dyes [dice] and 
other gamys. And this maner of table is double and arrayd wyth dyerse 
colour s ." Of the making of writing tables , of wood used for floo ring 
that " set in solar floo rs serue all men and best ys y{t} ben there in , 
and ben treden of all e men and be est ys that come there in ," and so 
strong that " they ben de not nor croke [crack] whan they ben pre ssyd 
w{t} heuy thynges lay d on them ." And also of boards used for ship s, 
bridge s, hulks and c off ers, and " in shypbreche [shipwreck] men fle to 
bor des and ben ofte sauyd in peryll ." Of the building of house s with 
roof s of " trees stretc hyd from the walles up to the to ppe of ye 
house ," with rafters "stronge and square and hewen play ne ," and of 
" the cove ring of stra we and the t che [thatch] ." Of the making of linen 
from the soak ing of the flax in water till it is dr ied and turned in 
the sun and then bound in "praty bundels" and "afterward knockyd, 
be ten and brayd and carflyd, rodded and gnodded; ribbyd and heklyd and 
at the last e sponne ," of the bl each ing, and final ly of its many uses 
for making cloth ing, and for sail s, and fish net s, and th read , and 
rope s, and st ring s (" for bows" ), and measu ring lines , and she et s (" to 
reste in " ), and s a cke s, and bagge s, and purses (" to put and to kepe 
thynges in " ). Of the making of tow " un even and full of knob s," used 
for stuff ing into the cracks in ship s, and " for bonds and by ndynges 
and matches for can delle s, for it is full drye and takyth s one fyre 
and brenn eth ." "And so ," he con cludes somewhat breath less ly , " none 
herbe is so nedefull to so many dyurrse uses to man kynde as is the 
flexe ." Of the vineyard "closyd about wyth walles and wyth hegge s, 
with a way te [watch] set in an hyghe place to kepe the vynyerde that 
the fruyte be not dystroyed ." Of the des ola tion of the vineyard in 
wint er, " but in harueste tyme many comyth and haunt eth the vynyerde ." 
Of the delicious smell of a vineyard . Of the damage done by foxes and 
swine and " tame hounds ." "A few hounds ," Bartholomew tells us , "wasten 
and dystroye moo grapes that cometh and et eth ther of the uyl ly 
[thievishly] ." "A vineyard ," he con cludes , "maye not be kepte nother 
sauyd but by his socou r and helpe that all thynge hath and possess eth 
in his power and myght e. And kepyth and sauyth all lord ly and 
myght i ly ." And is there any other writer who in so few words tells us 
of the wood s in those days ? Of the " be est is and foul is " there in as 
well as the herbs, of the wood s in summer - time , of the hunting 
there in , of the robber s and the difficult y of find ing one 's way ? Of 
the birds and the bees and the wild honey and the delicious cool ness 
of the deep shade in summer , and the "wery wayfarynge trauelynge men " ? 
And the final brief suggest ion of the time when forests were ver it able 
bound aries? I believe also that this is the only book in which we are 
told of the interesting old custom of ty ing knots to the trees " in 
token and mark e of ye high e waye ," and of robber s deli be rate ly 
remov ing them. The picture is so perfect that I give it in full :-- 

"Woods ben w ide places was t and desolate y{t} many trees 
growe in w{t} out e fruyte and also few hauyinge fruyte . And 
those trees whyche ben bareyne and be er eth noo maner e 
fruyte al waye ben generally more and hyghe r than ̄e y{t} 
wyth fruyte , fewe out taken as O ke and Beche. In thys e wodes 
ben ofte wylde bees tes and foul is . There in growyth herbes , 
grasse, le es and past ure, and name ly medycyn all herbes in 
wodes foūde. In some r wodes ben be wtyed [beautied] wyth 
bowes and braunches , w{t} herbes and grasse. In wode is 
place of disceyte [deceit] and of hunty nge. For ther in wylde 
be est ben hunted : and watches and disceyte s [deceits] ben 
ordenyd and lette of houn des and of hunters. There is place 
of hidynge and of lurkyng. For ofte in wodes the uys ben hyd , 
and oft in their away tes and disceyte s pass yng men cometh 
and ben spoylled and robbed and ofte slayne. And soo for 
many and dyuers e wayes and uncerten st range men ofte er re 
and goo out of the waye . And take uncerten waye and the waye 
that is unknowen before the waye that is know en and come oft 
to the place these the ues lye in away te and not wyth out 
peryll . There fore ben ofte knottes made on trees and in 
busshes in bowes and in braunches of trees ; in token and 
mark e of ye high e waye ; to she we the certen and sure waye to 
waye far e ynge men . But oft the uys in to rn ynge and met yng of 
wayes chaung e suche knottes and sign es and be gy le many men 
and brynge them out of the ryght waye by false token s and 
sygnes. By rdes , foul es and be in [bees] fle eth to wode , 
by rdes to make neste s and be in [bees] to gadre hony . By rdes 
to kepe themself from foul ers and be in [bees] to hyde 
themself to make hony comb es pre ue ly in holo we trees and 
stockes. Also wodes for thy knesse of trees ben colde with 
shadowe . And in he te of the sonne we ry wayfarynge and 
trauelynge men haue ly kyng e to have reste and to hele 
themself in the shadow. Many wodes ben be twyne dyuers 
coū trees and l on des : and de part yth they m asondre. And by 
we u ynge and cast yng to gyder of trees of ten men kepe th and 
defen dyth themself from enymies."[43] 

Bartholomew 's book on herbs ends thus: "And here we shall fynys she 
and ende in treat yng of the XV II boke whyche hath treat ed as ye may 
open ly know e of suche thynges as the Make r of all thyng hath order ed 
and brought forth by his myghty power to embelyssh and aray e the er the 
wyth and most specyal ly for ye fode of man and beast ." 

At the end of the book is the poem which has caused so much 
con troversy amongst bibliographers. In this Wynken de Worde definite ly 
state s that Caxton had a sh are in the first printing of this book at 
Cologne :-- 

"And also of your charyte call to remembraunce 
The soul e of William Caxton first prȳter of this boke . 
In late n to nge at Coleyn hys elf to auauce 
That every well disposed man may there in loke ." 

In spite of this , modern bibliographers are of opinion that Caxton 
could not have played even a sub ordinate part in the printing of this 
book at Cologne . 

De Worde also refers to the make r of the paper[44] :-- 

" ... John Tate the yonger ... 
Which late hath e in England doo make this paper thynne 
That now in our Englysh this boke is prynt ed In ne ." 

There is charm as well as pathos in the verses on the reproduc tion of 
manuscripts in book form , show ing us vivid ly what the recent discover y 
of the art of printing meant to the scholars of that day . The simile 
of Phœbus "repairing" the moon is very apt. 

"For yf one thyng myght last e a M yere 
Full s one comyth aege that frettyth all away ; 
But like as Phebus wyth his be me s cl ere 
The m one repeyr eth as bryght as on y day 
Whan she is was ted ryght ; so may we say 
This e boke s old and blynde whan we re newe 
By good ly prynt yng they ben bryght of he we ." 

The last verse of the poem is as follows :-- 

"No we gloryous god that regn est one in thre 
And thre in one graunt e vertu myght and grace 
Un to the prynt er of this we rke that he 
May be rewarded in thy heuen ly place 
And whan the worlde shall come before thy face 
There to rece ue accord yng to des ert 
Of grace and mercy make hym then expert ." 

The treatise on herbs formed , as we have seen , only a part of 
Bartholomew 's _De Proprietatibus Rerum_ , and , to speak strict ly , the 
first printed English herbal was the small quarto volume published by 
Richard Banckes in 152 5 . It was the beginning of a series of small 
books [45] chief ly in black letter . All of them, though issued from 
different pre sse s, have nearly the same title , and they va ry only 
s light ly from the original _Banckes's Herbal_ . The title of this 
Herbal is -- 

" Here begynn eth a new ma ter / the whiche sheweth and | 
treat eth of ye vertues & prop ry tes of her- | be s / the 
whiche is called | an Herb all ['.'] | ¶ Cum gra tia & 
priuilegio | a rege in dul to | 

"(_Colophon_) ¶ Imprynted by me Rycharde Banckes / dwell ynge 
in | Lōdō / a lytel fro ye Stockes in ye Pul try / ye 
XXV day of | March e. The yere of our Lorde MCCCC C. & XXV ." 

We do not know who the author of this book was , and it has been 
suggested that it is based on some mediæval English manuscript now 
lost . Certa in ly when one read s this anonymous work known as _Banckes's 
Herbal_ one is struck not only by its super iority to the later and 
more famous _Grete Herball_ , but also by its greater charm . It gives 
the impression of being a compilation from various source s, the author 
having made his own selec tion from what pleased him most in the older 
English manuscript herbals . It seems to have been a labour of love, 
where as the _Grete Herball_ is merely a translation . It is almost 
certain that the writer made use of one of the numerous manuscript 
vers ions of Macer's Herbal , which in parts _Banckes's Herbal_ 
resembles very closely , and the chapter on rosemary show s that he had 
access to one of the copies of the manuscript on the virtues of 
rosemary which was sent by the Countess of Hainault to Queen Philippa . 
He does not give the beautiful old tradition preserve d in that 
manuscript ,[46] but he ascribes wonderful virtues to this herb , with 
the same loving enthusiasm and almost in the same words . Of rosemary 
in _Banckes's Herbal_ we read :-- 

"Take the flowers thereof and make powder thereof and binde 
it to thy right arme in a linnen cloath and it shale make 
thee light and merrie. 

"Take the flowers and put them in thy che st among thy 
cloth es or among thy Book es and Mothes shall not destroy 
them. 

"B oyle the leaves in white wine and was he thy face there with 
and thy br owes and thou shalt have a fair e face . 

"Also put the leaves under thy bed de and thou shalt be 
delivered of all evil l dreames. 

"Take the leaves and put them into wine and it shall keep 
the wine from all s our ness and evil l savour s and if thou 
wilt sell thy wine thou shalt have good e speede. 

"Also if thou be feeb le boyle the leaves in clean e water and 
was he thyself and thou shalt wax shiny. 

"Also if thou have lost appetite of eat ing boyle well these 
leaves in clean e water and when the water is colde put 
there unto as much of white wine and then make sop s, eat them 
thereof wel and thou shalt restore thy appetite again e. 

"If thy legges be blow en with gowte boyle the leaves in 
water and binde them in a linnen cloath and wind e it about 
thy legges and it shall do thee much good . 

"If thou have a cough drink the water of the leaves boy ld in 
white wine and ye shall be whole . 

[Illustration: INITIAL LETTERS FROM "BANCKES'S HERBAL "] 

"Take the Timber thereof and burn it to coal es and make 
powder thereof and rub be thy teeth thereof and it shall keep 
thy teeth from all evil s. Smell it oft and it shall keep 
thee young ly . 

"Also if a man have lost his smell yng of the ayre that he 
may not draw his breath make a fire of the wood and bak e his 
bread there with , eat e it and it shall keep e him well . 

" Make thee a b ox of the wood of rosemary and smell to it and 
it shall preserve thy youth ." 

That _Banckes's Herbal_ achieved immediate popular ity is attested by 
the fact that the following year another edition of it was issued , and 
during the next thirty years various London printer s issued the same 
book under different title s.[47] Robert Wyer[48] ascribed the 
author ship of those he issued to Macer , and in the edition of 15 30 he 
added , after " Macer's Herbal ," "Practysed by Dr. Lynacro ." Whet her 
this state ment is true it is impossible to discover , but we know that 
the great doctor died some years before Wyer set up as a printer , and 
his name does not appear in any of the sub sequent editions of the 
herbal issued by other printer s. In Wyer 's edition there are some good 
initial letters very similar to those used by Wynkyn de Worde . 

The most interesting edition of the herbal is that printed by William 
Copland , in which first appear the addition al chapter s on "The virtues 
of water s stylled ," "The tyme of gather ing of sedes" and "A general 
rule of all maner of herbes ." He issued two editions bear ing the same 
title and diffe ring only in the woodcut s and the colophon. The title 
is "A boke of the | prop reties of Herbes called an her- | b all , 
where unto is added the tyme y{e} | herbes , floures and Se des s hold | 
be gathered to be kept the whole , ye - | re , with the vertue of ye 
Herbes whē | they are stylled . Al - | so a general l rule of all 
ma - | ner of Herbes draw en | out of an auncyent | booke of Phisyck | 
by W. C. " The woodcut in the first edition is three "Tudor" roses in a 
double circle with a cr own over one of the roses and a cross the rib and 
"Kȳge of floures ." In the second edition the woodcut is a quaint 
little represen tation of a lady seat ed in a garden . One man stand ing 
behind her is holding her and another is walking to wards her . The 
three figures are near a w all , on the other side of which several men 
are apparently con versing. Who W. C. was is uncerta in . In the 
_Dictionary of National Biography_ William Copland is said to be both 
the author and the printer of the book , but in many catalogue s 
( notably in that of the British Museum ) Walter Cary figures as the 
author . In a leng thy account of the Cary s in _Notes and Queries_ 
( March 29, 1913) Mr. A . L. Humphreys disposes con cl us ive ly of the 
sup position that W. C. can stand for Walter Cary . 

" _A Boke of the Properties of Herbes_ bear s on the 
title-page the initial s W. C. , which may stand either for 
Copland or Cary . This was one of several editions of 
_Banckes's Herbal_ , then very popular , and although it may 
have been edited or pro moted in some way by a Walter Cary , 
it could not have been by the one who wrote _The Hammer for 
the Stone _. The 'Herball' was issued some where about 1550 
and various editions of it exist , but all these appear ed 
when the Walter Cary we are consider ing was a child . There 
is , however, a connection between the Cary s and herbals , 
because it is well known that Henry Lyte (1529-1607) of 
Lyte s Cary was the famous translator of Dodoens 's _ Herball_ 
(1578), and he had a herbal garden at Lyte s Cary ." 

Ames in his _Typographical Antiquities_ describe s the two editions , 
which are identical, as though they were two different books , and 
ascribes one to Walter Cary and the other to William Copland . We have 
only Ames 's authority for the sup position that Copland was the 
compiler as well as the printer . The herbal in quest ion is merely 
another edition of _Banckes's Herbal_ , but it is quite possible that 
the three addition al chapter s at the end were " draw en out of an 
auncyent booke of Physick" by Copland .[49] 

T wo editions of _Banckes's Herbal_ are ascribed , on account of the 
word ing of the title , to Antony Askham, and the title is so attractive 
that it is a disap point ment to find that the astrological addition s 
"declar yng what herbes hath influence of certain sterres and 
constellation s," etc., do not appear in any known copy of the herbal . 
This astrological lore from the famous man who combined the 
profess ions of priest, physician and astrologer in the reign of Edward 
VI . would be of remarkable interest . But it has been pointed out by 
Mr. H. M. Barlow[50] that , if the bibliographers who have attributed 
the work to Askham had examined the title of the work with greater 
care , they would have observed that the phrase " by Anthonye Askham " 
refers not to the substance of the book itself ( which is merely 
another edition of _Banckes's Herbal_ ) but to the "A lmanacke" from 
which the addition s were intended to be taken , though apparently they 
were never printed . The title of "Askham's" Herbal is -- 

"A lytel | herball of the | properties of her- | be s newe ly 
am ended and correct ed , | with certayne add ic ions at the ende 
| of the boke , declary ing what herbes | hath influence of 
certain e Sterres | and constellation s, where by may be | 
chosen the beast and most luck ye | tyme s and dayes of their 
mini- | stra c ion, accord yinge to the | Moone being in the 
sig- | nes of heauen, the | which is day ly | appoynted | in 
the | Almanacke; made and gathered | in the yere of our 
Lorde god | M.D.L. the XII. day of Fe- | bruary by Anthonye 
| Askham Phi- | sycyon. 

"(_Colophon._) Imprynted at | London in Flete- | strete at 
the sign e of the George | next to Saynte Dun stones | Church e 
by Wylly- | am Po well . | In the ye are of oure Lorde | M.D.L. 
the twelfe day of March e." 

There are some charm ing prescriptions to be found in "Askham's" 
Herbal . Under " rose ," for instance, we have recipes for "melroset ," 
"sugar rose t ," " sy rope of Roose s," " oyle of roses " and " rose water ." 

"Melro sette is made thus. Take fair e purified hony e and new 
read roose s, the whyte ende s of them clyp ped away e, thā 
chop they m smal and put thē into the Hony and boy l thē 
men e ly together ; to know whan it is boyle d ynoughe, ye shal 
know it by the swete odour and the colour read . Fyve yeares 
he may be kept in his vertue ; by the Rose s he hath vertue of 
comfort ing e and by the hony he hath vertu of clens ing e. 

"Syrope of Roose s is made thus. Some do take roses dy ght as 
it is sayd and boyle them in water and in the water strayn ed 
thei put suger and make a sirope thereof ; and some do make 
it better , for they put roses in a vessel l , hau ing a 
stra y ght mouthe, and they put to the roses hote water and 
thei let it stande a day and a night and of that water , 
put t ing to it suger , thei do make sirope , and some do e put 
more of Rose s in the for said vessel and more of hote water , 
and let it stande as is before said e, and so they make a read 
water and make the rose syrope. And some do stāpe new 
Rose s and then strayn e out the joyce of it and suger 
the rwyth, they make sirope : and this is the best making of 
sirope . In Wynter and in Some r it maye be geuen competent ly 
to feble sick e melāco ly and colorike people . 

"Sugar Rose t is made thus-- Take newe gathered roses and 
stāpe them right e smal with sugar, thā put in a glasse 
XXX. dayes , let it stande in ye sunne and stirre it wel , and 
medle it well together so it may be kept three yeares in his 
vertue . The qu ātitie of sugar and roses should be thus. 
In I III. pound of sugar a pound e of roses . 

"Oyle of roses is made thus. Some boyle roses in oyle and 
kepe it , some do fyll a glasse with roses and oyle and they 
boyle it in a caudr on full of water and this oyle is good . 
Some stampe fresh roses with oyle and they put it in a 
vessel of glasse and set it in the sūne I III. d a is and 
this oyle is good . 

" Rose water . Some do put rose water in a glass and they put 
roses with their de w ther to and they make it to boil e in 
water thā thei set it in the sun e tyll it be read de and 
this water is best e." 

Under the same flower we find this fragrant example of the widespread 
mediæval belief in the efficacy of good smell s :-- 

"Also drye roses put to ye nose to smell do cōforte the 
braine and the harte and quencheth sp rite ." 

The herbalists were never we ary of teach ing the value of sweet 
scents.[51] "If odour s may worke satisfac tion ," wrote Gerard in his 
_ Herball_ , " they are so soveraigne in plants and so comfort able that 
no confection of the apothecaries can equall their excellent vertue ." 
One of the most delicious "scent" prescriptions in Askham is to be 
found under V io let -- "For thē that may not slepe for sickness se eth 
this herb in water and at euen let him so ke well hys feet e in the 
water to the ancle s, whā he go eth to bed , bind of this herbe to his 
temp les and he shall slepe wel by the grace of God ." 

The most curious recipe is that under " wood binde ." "Go to the roote of 
wood binde and make a hole in the mid des of the roote , than c over it 
well again e y{t} no ayre go out nor that no rayne go in , no water , 
nor earth nor the sun e come not to much to it , let it stande so a 
night and a day, thā after that go to it and thou shalt fynde 
there in a certayne lycoure . Take out that lycoure with a sp one and put 
it into a clean gla s and do so every day as long as thou fynde st ought 
in the hole , and this must be done in the m on eth of April or May e, 
than anoynt the sore ther with against the fyre , thā we te a ly nnen 
cloth e in the same lycoure and la ppe it about the sore and it shal be 
hole in short e space on war rantyse by the Grace of God ." 

Unlike the later _Grete Herball_ , Askham gives some descriptions of 
the herbs themselves , notably in the case of alleluia (wood-sorrel ), 
water crowfoot, and a ster ion. 

"This herbe alleluia mē call it Wods our or Stub wort, this 
herbe hath thre leaves ye which be roūd a litel departed 
aboue and it hath a whyte flour , but it hath no lōge 
stalke s and it is Woods oure and it is like thre le ued 
grasse. The vertue of this herbe is thus, if it be rosted in 
the ashes in red dock e leaves or in red wort leaves it 
frett eth awai dead flesh of a wound e. This herbe groweth 
much in wood es ." 

Water crowfoot : "This herb that men call water crowfoot hath 
yelow floures , as hath crowfoot and of the same shap, but 
the leves are more departed as it were Rammes fete, and it 
hath a long stalke and out of that one stalke groweth many 
stalke s smal by ye sides . This herb groweth in water y 
places ." 

"A ster ion or Lunary groweth among stoones and in high 
places , this herb shyneth by night and he bring eth forth 
purple floures hole and round e as a knockebell or else lyke 
to foxg love s, the leves of this herbe be round e and blew and 
they have the mark of the Moone in the myddes as it were 
thre leved grasse, but the leaves ther of be more and they be 
round as a peny. And the stalk of this herb is red and thys e 
herb semeth as it were musk and the joyce ther of is yelow 
and this groweth in the new Moone without leve and euery day 
spryngeth a newe leaue to the ende of fyftene dayes and 
after fyftene dayes it loos eth euery day a leaue as the 
Moone waneth and it springeth and waneth as doth the Moone 
and where that it groweth there groweth great qu antitie. 

"The vertue of this herbe is thus-- thei that eat of the 
be r is or of the herbe in wa ning of the moon e, whā he is 
in s igno virg in is if he have the fall ing euell he shal be 
hole thereof or if he be are thys about his neck he shal be 
holpen without doute. And it hath many more vertues than I 
can tell at this tyme ." 

One of the un identified herbs is called " sene ," and we are given the 
somewhat vague geographical information , " It groweth in the other syde 
the sea and moste about e Babil on ." 

* * * * * 

Another small book printed by William Copland must be mentioned , for , 
although it is not a herbal, it contain s a great deal of curious herb 
lore not to be found else where . This is _The boke of secretes of 
Albartus Magnu s of the vertues of Herbes , Stone s, and certain e 
beast es _. Who the author was is unknown , but he was certain ly not 
Albert of Bollstadt (1193-1280 ), Bishop of Ratisbon, the scholastic 
philosop her to whom it was ascribed , probably in order to increase its 
sale. There is one philosop hical remark which is not un worthy of the 
famous Bishop : " E very man de sp is eth ye thyng where of he know eth 
no thynge and that hath done no pleasure to him ." But for the most part 
it deal s with the popular beliefs concerning the mystic al properties 
of herbs, stones and animals. 

Of celandine the writer tells us: "This hear be springeth in the time 
in ye which the swallowes and also ye Eagles maketh theyr neste s. If 
any man shal have this herbe with ye harte of a Molle (mole) he shall 
over come all his enemies .... And if the before named hear be be put 
upon the head de of a sy cke man if he should dye he shal s yng an one 
with a loud voyce, if not he shall we ep ." 

"Perwynke when it is be atē unto pouder with worm es of ye earth 
wrap ped about e it and with an herbe called houslyke it in duc eth love 
between man and wyfe if it be e used in their meales ... if the say de 
confection be put in the fyre it shall be turned an one unto blue 
colour e." 

Of the herb which , he tells us , " the men of Chaldea called roybra ," he 
says: " He that hold eth this herbe in hys hāde with an herbe called 
Mylf oyle or yaro we or noseblede is sure from all fear e and fantasye or 
vys ion. And yf it be put with the juyce of house lyke and the bear ers 
hands be anoynt ed with it and the residue be put in water if he en tre 
in ye water where fyshes be they wil gather together to hys hand es ... 
and if hys hand e be draw ē forth they will leap e agayne to they re 
owne places where they were before ." 

Of houn d 's tongue : "If ye shall have the afore named herbe under thy 
for most to e al the dogges shall kepe silence and shall not have power 
to bark. And if thou shalt put the aforesayde thinge in the neck e of 
any dog ge so y{t} he maye not touch e it with his mou the he shal be 
turned always round about lyke a turn ing whele un till he fall unto the 
ground e as dead and this hath bene prove d in our tyme ." 

Of centaury : "If it be joy n ed with the blo ude of a female lap wing or 
black pl over and be put with oyle in a lampe, all they that compasse 
it about e shal be le ue themselves to be witches so that one shall 
be leve of an other that his head is in heaven and his fete in the 
earth . And if the afore said thynge be put in the fire whan the star re s 
sh in e it shall appear e y{t} the sterres run ne one agaynste another and 
fy ght ." 

Of vervain : "This herbe ( as witches say ) gathered , the sunne be yng in 
the sign e of the Ram, and put with grayne or corn e of pyonie of one 
ye are old e heal eth them y{t} be sick e of ye fall ing sykenes ." 

Of powder of roses : "If the aforesayde poulder be put in a lampe and 
after be kind led all men shall appear e black e as the deuell. And if 
the afore said poulder be mixed with oyle of the olyue tree and with 
qu y cke brymst one and the house anointed wyth it , the Sunne shyn ing, it 
shall appear e all in flamed ." 

[Illustration: WOODCUT FROM THE TITLE-PAGE OF THE "GRETE HERBALL" 
(1526) ] 

Of verbena : "In fants bear ing it shal be very apte to learn e and lou ing 
learn ynge and they shal be glad and joyous ." 

It is the only book on the virtues of herbs in which I have found a 
recipe to rev ive dr own ing flies and bees ! This is to be done by 
pl ac ing them in warm ashes of penny royal , and then " they shall recover 
their lyfe after a little tyme as by ye space of one h oure ." The book 
ends with a curious philosop hical dissertat ion, " Of the mervels of the 
worlde ," which is followed by a series of charms -- to s top a cock 
cr ow ing, to make men look as though they had no heads, to obtain rule 
over all birds , to keep flies away from a house , to write letters 
which can only be read at night , to make men look as though they had 
" the count enance of a dog ," to make men seem as though they had three 
heads, to understand the language of birds , to make men seem like 
angel s, and to put things in the fire without their being consum ed .

Thou gh lacking in the charm of the quaint and typical ly English 
_Banckes's Herbal_ , the most famous of the early printed herbals was 
the _Grete Herball_ printed by Peter Treveris in 152 6. [52] 

"The grete herball | whiche geueth parfyt knowlege and 
under - | stand yng of all maner of herbes & there gra cyous 
vertues whiche god hath | ordeyned for our prosperous 
welfare and helth, for they hele & cure all maner | of 
dyseases and sekenesses that fall or my sfortune to all maner 
of creatoures | of god created , prac ty s ed by many expert and 
wyse mayst ers, as Auicenna and | other & c . Also it geueth 
full parfyt e understand ynge of the booke late ly pryn | ted 
by me ( Peter treveris) named the noble experiens of the 
vertuous hand | warke of surgery ." 

(_Colophon._) "Imprentyd at London in South- | warke by me 
peter Treueri s, dwel- | ly nge in the sygne of the wodows | 
In the yere of our Lorde god M.D. | XXV I the XXV II day of 
Ju ly ." 

According to the in tro duc tion it was compiled from the works of " many 
noble doctoures and expert e mayst ers in medecine s, as Auicenna , 
Pandecta, Constantinu s, Wilhelmu s, Plateariu s, Rabbi Moyse s, Johannes 
Mesue, Haly, Albert us , Bartholomeus and more other ." But with the 
exception of the preface the _Grete Herball_ is a translation of the 
well-known French herbal, _Le Grant Herbier_ . Until about 1886 _Le 
Grant Herbier_ was supposed to be a translation of the _Herbarius zu 
Teutsch_ , published at Mainz in 1485 , or of the _Ortus Sanitatis _, 
printed also at Mainz in 1491.[53] The _Herbarius zu Teutsch_ , which 
was probably compiled by a Frankfort physician , is a fine herbal 
beautiful ly illustrated , and the later _Ortus Sanitatis _ is by some 
authorities supposed to be a Latin translation of it . To judge from 
the preface to the German Herbarius it was a labour of love, 
under taken by a man who apparently was possess ed of ample wealth and 
leisure; for in his preface he tells us that he " caused this 
praiseworthy work to be begun by a Master learned in physic ," and 
then , find ing that as many of the herbs did not grow in his native 
land he could not draw them " with their true colour s and form ," he 
left the work un finished and journeyed through many land s -- Italy , 
Croatia, Albania, Dalmatia, Greece, Corfu, Candia, Rhode s, Cypru s, the 
Ho ly L and , Arabia, Babylonia and Egypt. He was accomp anied by " a 
painter ready of wit and cunning and sub tle of hand ," and was th us 
able to have the herbs "tru ly draw n ." The book he compiled on his 
re turn was long regarded as the original of the French herbal, _Le 
Grant Herbier_ , but in 1866 Professor Giulio Camus found two 
fifteen th - century manuscripts in the Biblioteca Estense at Modena, one 
the Latin work commonly known from the open ing words as _Circa 
Instans_ , and the other a French translation of the same manuscript . 
It was always supposed by medical historia ns that the _Circa Instans_ 
was written by Matthaeus Plateariu s of Salerno in the twelfth century , 
but in Professor Camus 's memoir, _L'Opéra Saleritana "Circa In stans " 
ed il tes to primitivo del "Gr and Herb ier in Francoys" secundo duo 
codici del secolo XV con servati nella Regia Biblioteca Estense _, there 
are reproduc ed the French verses in which occurs the line , "I l a est é 
es cript Millccc cinquante et hu it ," and Mr. H. M. Barlow[54] supp or ts 
the de duc tion that _Circa Instans_ was not written by a Salernitan 
physician , but by a writer described in the verses as "B artholomaeus 
minid' senis" in 14 58. _Le Grant Herbier_ , of which the English _Grete 
Herball_ is a translation , is a vers ion of the French manuscript 
translation of _Circa Instans_ , and therefore , as _Circa Instans_ is 
older than either the _Herbarius zu Teutsch_ or the Latin _Ortus 
Sanitatis _, it would seem that it is the real original of our _Grete 
Herball_ . The preface to the _Grete Herball_ , however, bear s a strong 
resemblance to that of the German Herbarius , of which I quote a part 
from Dr. Arber 's translation , made from the second (Augsburg) edition 
of 1485 . They have been place d in parallel columns to show how closely 
the English preface follows that of the German Herbarius . 

Pre face to the _Herbarius zu Teutsch_ . 

" Many a time and oft have I con temp late d 
in ward ly the wondrous 
works of the creator of the uni verse : 
how in the beginning He formed 
the heaven s and adorned them with 
good ly sh in ing stars , to which he 
gave power and might to influence 
everything under heaven . Also how 
he after wards formed the four elements : 
fire , hot and dry -- air , hot 
and moist-- water , cold and moist-- earth , 
dry and cold -- and gave to 
each a nature of its own ; and how 
after this the same Great Master of 
Nature made and formed herbs of 
many sort s and animals of all kind s 
and last of all Man, the noble st of 
all created things . There upon I 
thought on the wondrous order which 
the Creator gave these same creatures 
of His , so that everything which 
has its being under heaven rece ive s 
it from the stars and keep s it by 
their help . I consider ed further how 
that in everything which a rise s, grows , 
live s or soars in the four elements 
named , be it metal, stone , herb or 
animal, the four nature s of the elements , 
he at , cold , moist ness and 
dry ness, are mingle d . It is also to 
be not ed that the four nature s in 
quest ion are also mixed and bl ended 
in the human body in a measure and 
temperament su it able to the life and 
nature of man ; while man keep s 
with in this measure ... he is strong 
and health y, but as soon as he steps 
or fall s beyond ... which happens 
when he at take s the up per hand and 
strives to stifle cold or on the contrary 
when cold begins to supp ress 
he at ... he fall s of necessity into 
sickness and draw s nigh unto death . 
... Of a truth I would as soon count 
the leaves on the trees or the gra in s 
of s and in the sea as the things 
which are the cause s of man's sickness . 
It is for this reason that so 
many thousand s and thousand s of 
perils and dangers be set man . He is 
not ful ly sure of his health or his 
life for one moment. While consider ing 
these matter s, I also remembe red 
how the Creator of Nature , 
who has place d us a mid such dangers 
has merci ful ly pro vided us with a 
remedy, that is with all kind s of 
herbs, animals and other created 
things .... By virtue of these herbs 
and created things the sick man may 
recover the temperament of the four 
elements and the health of his body . 
Since then man can have no greater 
nor noble r treasure on earth than 
bodi ly health , I came to the conclusion 
that I could not per form any 
more use ful and holy work than to 
compile a book in which could be 
contain ed the virtue and nature of 
many herbs and other created things , 
together with their true colour s and 
for the help of all the world , and the 
common good , therefore I caused 
this praiseworthy work to be begun 
by a Master learned in physic who , 
at my re quest gathered into a book 
the nature and virtue of many herbs 
out of the acknowled ged master s of 
physic , Galen , Avicenna, Serapio, 
Dioscorides , Pandectariu s, Plateariu s 
and others ."

The illustrations in the _Grete Herball_ are poor , being merely 
inferior copies of those in the later editions of the _Herbarius zu 
Teutsch_ .[55] In the majority of cases it is impossible to identify 
the plant from the figure , and the same figure is some times pre fixed 
to different plants . But if the illustrations are poor and dull the 
frontispiece and the full - page woodcut of the printer's mark are very 
much the reverse. The frontispiece is a charm ing woodcut of a man 
holding a spade in his right hand and gather ing grapes , and a woman 
throw ing flowers and herbs out of her apr on into a basket. There are 
two figures in the low er corn ers, the one of a male and the other of a 
female mandrake . The woodcut of the printer's mark at the end she ds an 
interesting ray of light on the Peter Treveris who issued the two 
first editions of this Herbal l.[56] The woodcut represen ts two 
wodows [57] ( sav ages ), a man and a woman , on either side of a tree, 
from which is suspended a shield with Peter Treveris 's initial s. Ames 
supp oses that Treveris was a native of Trèves and took his name from 
that city, but it is more like ly that he was a member of the Cornish 
family of Treffry, which is some times spelt Treveris . A Sir John 
Treffry, who fought at Poiti ers, took as supp orters to his arms a wild 
man and woman , and one like s to find that one of his descendant s 
perpetuated the memory of his gallant ancestor by adopt ing the same 
sign for his trade device . 

The _Grete Herball_ is alpha be tical ly arranged, for the idea of the 
natural relation ship of plants was unknown at that time . But we find a 
"classification" of fungi. "Fungi ben musherons. There be two maner s 
of them, one maner is deadly and s le eth them that eat eth of them and 
the other dooth not " ! As in most sixteenth- and seventeenth-century 
herbals , there are quaint descriptions of a good many things be sides 
herbs. The most grue some of these is a substance brief ly described as 
"mummy ," and the accompanying illustration is of a man digging be side 
a to mb. "Mum my ," one read s, " is a maner of spyces or con fectyons that 
is founde in the sepulchres or to m be s of dead body es that haue be 
confyct with spyces . And it is to wyt e that in old e tyme men were wont 
to confyct the deed corpses and anoynt e them with bawme and my re 
smell ynge swete . And yet ye paynims about babyl on kepe that custom e 
for there is grete qu an t ity of bawme . And this mummye is special ly 
founde about the brayne and about the maronge in the rydge bone. For 
the blo de by reason of the bawme draweth to the brayne and there about 
is chauffed. And lyke wise is the brayne b rent and parched and is the 
qu antyte of mommye and so the blo de is mroeued in the rydge of the 
back e. That mommye is to be chosen that is bryght black e stynkynge and 
styffe. And that y{t} is why t and draweth to a dymme colour and that 
is not stynkynge nor styffe, and that powdr eth light ly is naught. It 
hath vertue to rest rayne or staunch e." [58]

OF THE "GRETE HERBALL" (1561) ] 

Other substance s described are salt , che es e, pitch, lead , silv er, 
gold , am b er, water , star ch , vinegar, butter , honey and the lodest one . 
The dissertat ion on water show s very cl early that our ancestors 
regarded bath ing as a fad, and a dangerous fad at that . The writer 
gloom i ly observe s, " many folk e that hath bath ed them in colde water 
haue dyed or they came home ." And those who are foolish enough to 
drink water he war ns by quot ing the authority of "Mayster Isaac ," who 
"sayth that it is impossible for them that drynk eth over muche water in 
theyr youth to come to ye age that God hath ordeyned them ." In the 
description of the lodest one we find the well-known popular belief 
about ship s being draw n to their de struct ion. "The lodest one , the 
adamant stone that draweth yren hath myght e to draw yren as Aristotle 
sayth. And is founde in the brymmes of the occyan see . And there be 
hill is of it and these hyll is draw e ye ship pes that haue nayles of 
yren to them and breke the shyppes by draw ynge of the nayles out ." The 
accompanying illustration is of a s in k ing ship with a man go ing 
to wards the hill of adamant with up lifted hands , while another man is 
swimm ing, and a third s its calmly in the ship . 

In view of the free use of honey in old en times , the account of honey 
in the _Grete Herball_ seems in adequate. " Hony is made by artyfyce and 
craft of bees . The whyche bees draweth the thynne st parte of the 
floures and parte lye of the thick est and moost grosse and thereof 
maketh hony and wax e and also they make a substaunce that is called 
the hony comb e. The tame hony is that that is made in the hous or hyues 
that labour ers ordeyn eth for the sayd bees to lodge and worke in . Hony 
is whyte in cold places and brown e in warm place . And hony ought to be 
put in medicyne and may be kept C yeeres. There is an other that is 
called wylde hony and is found in wood es and is not so good as the 
other and is more bytter . Also there is a honey called cast anea 
because it is made of che stayne floures that the bees suck eth and is 
bytter ." 

In the _Grete Herball_ , as in _Banckes's Herball_ , we find numerous 
instances of the use of herbs as amulets or for their effect on the 
mind , and for the smok ing of patient s with their fumes . I quote the 
following :-- 

"B etony. For them that be ferfull. For them that ben to 
fer full gyue two drag me s of powdr e here of wt warm e water and 
as moche wyne at the tyme that the fer e cometh ." 

"B uglos. To preserve the my nde. This herbe of ten eaten 
con fer me th and con seru eth the my n de as many wyse mayst ers 
sayth. " 

"To make folk e mery . Take the water that buglos hath b ē 
soden in and sprynkle it about the hous or chambre and all 
that be there in shall be mery ." 

" Verva in . To make folk e mery at ye table . To make all them 
in a hous to be mery take foure leaves and foure rotes of 
vervayn in wyne , than spryncle the wine all about the hous 
where the eat ynge is and they shall be all mery ." 

"Musk. Agaynst weyknesse of the brayne smel to musk ." 

"Struciūn. Against ly targye blow e the powdr e of the sede 
in to the nose or elles se the the sede thereof and juice of 
rue in strong e vyneygre and rub be the hynder parte of ye 
head ther with ." 

"A rtemisia. To make a child mery hang e a bondell of mugwort 
or make smoke thereof under the chylde 's bed de for it take th 
away annoy for he m ." 

" Rose mary. For weyknesse of ye brayne . Agaynst weyknesse of 
the brayne and colde nesse thereof , se the rosmar in in wyne 
and let e the pacyent rece ye the smoke at his nose and kepe 
his heed warm e." 

"Southernwood. The fume of it expell eth all serpent s out of 
the house and what so ever there abyde th dy eth ." 

There are two delicious violet recipes for "Syrope of Vyolettes" and 
" oyle of vyolettes ." 

"Syrope of vyolettes ī made in this maner -- Se the 
vyolettes in water and let e it lye all nygh t in ye same 
water . Than pour e and st reyne out the water , and in the same 
put sugre and make your syrope. 

"Oyle of vyolettes is made thus. Se the vyolettes in oyle and 
st reyne it . It will be oyle of vyolettes ." 

It is in this herbal that we find the first avowal of d is belief in the 
supposed powers of the mandrake . 

" There be two maner s the male and the female , the female 
hath sharp e leves . Some say that it is better for medycyn e 
than the male but we use of both e. Some say that the male 
hath figure of shape of a man . And the female of a woman but 
that is fals. For Nature never gaue for me or shape of 
mā kynde to an herbe . But it is of troughe that some hath 
shape d suche fygures by craft as we have for tyme her de say 
of labour ers in the fel des ." 

The _Grete Herball_ ends thus-- 

" O ye worthy red ers or prac ticyens to whom e this noble 
volume is pre sēt. I be se che you take in tell ygence and 
be holde ye work es and opera cyōs of al mighty god which

The only important books Treveris published be sides the _Grete 
Herball_ were the two English translation s of Hieronymus 
Braunschweig 's works ( _The noble experyence of the virtuous 
Handy- worke of Surgeri_ and _The vertuous e Book of the Dystillacion of 
the Water s of all maner of Herbes_ ) and the hand some edition of 
Trevisa 's translation of Higden 's _Polychroni con _. _The vertuous e Book 
of the Dystillacion of the Water s of all maner of Herbes_ is well 
printed , but the illustrations are from the same inferior German cuts 
as those in the _Grete Herball_ . The book was translated into English 
by Laurence Andrew and , though strict ly it does not come with in the 
category of herbals , part of the preface is too beautiful to omit. 
"Lerne the hygh and meruelous vertue of herbes . Kno we how inestimable

[48] Robert Wyer was one of the most famous printer s of the early 
sixteenth century . He came of a Buckinghamshire family and was 
probably a near relation of John Wyer , also a printer who lived in 
Flee t Street, for both of them used the device of St. John the 
Evange list . He serve d his apprentice ship to Richard Pynson, whose 
printing pre s s was in the rent al s of Nor wich House near the s it e of 
the present Villiers Street, and on Pyns on 's death succeeded to the 
busi ness . In both his editions of the herbal there is his well-known 
device of St. John the Evange list bareheaded and dres s ed in a f low ing 
rob e, sitt ing under a tree on an is land and writing on a scroll sp read 
over his right knee. At his right hand is an eagle with out stretc he d 
wing s holding an in k well in its be ak, and in the back ground are the 
tow ers and spires of a great city.

[51] The popular belief in the power of sweet - smell ing herbs to ward 
off in fec tion of the much -dreaded plague rose to its he ight in Charles 
II. 's reign , when bunches of rosemary were sold for six and 
eight pence. Till recent ly there were at least two surviv al s of this 
belief in herbal scents -- the doctor 's gold -headed cane ( former ly a 
pomander carried at the end of a cane ) and the little bouquets carried 
by the clergy at the distribu tion of the Maundy Money in Westminster 
Abbey.

CHAPTER III 

TURNER'S HERBAL AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE FOREIGN HERBAL ISTS 

"In the beginning of wint er the Goldfinches use muche to 
haunt e this herbe [teazle] for the sede s sake where of they 
are very des yrous."--_ Turner's Herbal_ , 155 1. 


Like so many sixteenth- century not abilitie s, William Turner , commonly 
known as the father of English botany, was remark ably vers atile, for 
he was a divine , a physician and a botanist. He was a native of 
Morpeth, Northumberland, and was born in Henry VI II. 's reign : the 
exact date is unknown . His father is supposed to have been a tann er. 
We know nothing of his early educat ion, but he entered what is now 
Pembroke College, [59] Cambridge, under the patron age of Thomas Lord 
Wentworth . This he himself tells us in the preface to the second part 
of his herbal, which is dedicated to Lord Wentworth of the next 
generat ion. "And who hath de serve d better to have my booke of herbs to 
be given to him , than he , whose father with his y early ex hibi tion did 
helpe me, be y ing student in Cambridge of Physi k and philosop hy? 
Where by with some further help and study am comm ed to this pore 
knowledge of herbes and other simple s that I have . Where fore I 
dedicate unto you this my litle boke , des y ring you to defen de it 
against the envious evil speak ers, which can a low nothing but that 
they do themselves : and the same I give unto your Lord ship , beseech ing 
to take it in the stede of a better thyng , and for a token of my good 
will to ward you , and all your father 's hous hold , which th ing if ye 
do , as sonne as I shall have convenient les ure, ye shall have the 
third and last parte of my herball also . Al mighty God kepe you and all 
your es . Amen. " 

At Cambridge Turner was intimate with Nicholas Ridley ( after wards the 
famous Bishop of London ), and though it is interesting to know that 
Ridley instructed him in Greek , it is even more attractive to learn 
that the future bishop also initiated him into the my steries of ten n is 
and archery. Turner did well at the university , for he was elected 
Ju nior Fellow of his college in 1531 and Joint Treasurer in 1532, and 
he had a title for Ord ers in 153 7. Throughout his life he was a 
staunch Protestant and at Cambridge he used to at t end the preach ing s 
of Hugh Latim er. We do not know how long Turner held his fel low ship , 
possibly till his marri age with Jan e, daughter of George And er, 
Alder man of Cambridge . He left Cambridge in 15 40 and travelled about , 
preach ing in various places . In Wood 's _A the næ Oxonienses_ we read , 
"In his rambles he settled for a time in Ox on among several of his 
country men that he found there , purpose ly for the conversation of men 
and books .... At the same time and after , following his old trade of 
preach ing without a call , he was imprisoned for a considerable 
time ." [60] On his release he left England and travelled in Italy , 
German y and Hol land . He tells us in his herbal that he visited 
Cremona, Como, Milan, Venice and Chiavenna, and at Bologna[61] he 
studied botany under Luca Ghini. Ei ther there or at Ferrara he took 
his M.D. degree . From Italy he went to Zurich, where he formed his 
intimate and life long friend ship with Conrad Gesner,[62] the famous 
Swiss natural is t . 

He subsequently visited Basle and Cologne , and it was in these two 
cit ies that his small religious books up holding the Protestant cause 
were printed . They were very popular in England , so much so that in 
the last year of Henry VI II. 's reign they were pro hibi ted . Turner 
spent some time botani sing in the Rhine country : in his herbal he 
speaks of different plants which he collect ed at Bonn, Basel, Bingen, 
Cologne , "Erenffelde" and "Sieburg ." Then he went to Hol land and East 
Friesl and -- the latter he frequent ly mention s -- and became physician to 
the "Erle of Emden ." It was probably at this time that he explo red the 
islands off the mainland . He was in correspondence with "Maister Ri che 
and maister Morgan, Apotecaries of London ," two names which , it is 
interesting to not e, occur also in de l'Obel 's works and in Gerard's 
Herbal . 

Turner wrote the first part of his Herbal when he was abroad, but he 
delayed publication until the conclusion of his wandering s. On his 
re turn to England he became chaplain and physician to the Duke of 
Somerset, and it is generally believed that he s at in the House of 
Commons.[63] He was promised the pre ben d of Botevant in York, and in a 
letter written to than k Cecil for the pro mise we find the remark , " My 
chylde r have bene f ed so long with hope that they are very leane, i 
w old fayne have thē fatter if it were possible ." 

Turner held this ap point ment for little more than two years , and after 
failing to obtain either the pro vost ship of Oriel College, Oxford, or 
the pre side ncy of Magdalen, he seems to have be come des pondent. He 
want ed a house " where i may studie in and have sū place to lay my 
book es in ," and in another letter he complains of " being pened up in a 
chamber with all my ho[use] holde seru an tes and child ren as she pe in a 
pyndfolde .... i can not go to my booke for ye cry ing of child er and 
noyse yt is made in my chamber ." Final ly he beg ged leave to go abroad, 
" where I will also fini she my great herball and my book es of fish es, 
stones and metalles if God send me lyfe and helthe ." He was 
subsequently made Dean of Well s, but he lost this off ice on the 
access ion of Mary, and , like so many of the Protestant divine s, he 
went abroad. He stayed at Bonn, Frankfort , Freiburg, Lauterburg [ ? 
Lauenburg], Mainz , Rodekirche, Strasburg, Spey er, Worm s, Cologne and 
We is senburg. At Cologne and We is senburg he had gardens , and it was 
from Cologne that he published the second part of his Herbal . His 
works were pro claim ed here tical for the second time in 155 5 , and the 
Wardens of every Comp any had to give not ice of any copy they had in 
order that they might be destroy ed . It is not surprising that Turner's 
works are rare! 

On the access ion of Elizabeth he returned to England and was 
reinstated in the deanery of We lls.[64] His diocesan seems to have 
found him troubleso me, for in 155 9 the Bishop of Ba th and Well s wrote : 

"I am much en comb red with m r. Doctor Turner Dean e of Well es 
for his in discreete be hav i or in the pulp it where he medle th 
w{th} all matter s .... I have advertised him by wrytynges and 
have admonished secret ly by his owne frendes : 
not with stand ing he persist eth still in his follie : he 
con ten̄ eth all Bishop ps and call eth thē white coat s, 
typpett gentlemē, with other word es of re pro che [mu] che 
more unsemlie and ask eth ' who gave them autoritie more ouer 
me then I ouer them ' ? 

"GILBERT BATH AND WELLS ." 
_ January 24, 
155 9-60._ 

There is a story told that Turner trained his dog at a given sign to 
snatch the bishop 's square cap off his head when the pre late was 
d in ing with him. If this is true , possibly it account s for the fact 
that he was subsequently suspended for Nonconformity, after which , 
being pre cluded from clerical dutie s, he left Well s and returned to 
London . He lived in Crutched Friars and , like the two other 
Elizabeth an herbalists , had a famous garden . He was in failing health 
when he complete d his herbal, and there is extant a pathetic letter 
( the greater part of it written by an amanuensis) to his staunch 
patron Lord Burleigh, which is sign ed "Y our old and seik ly cl ient 

wllm turn er doctor of physic ." 

Turner died in 1568, and was bur ied in S. Olave' s, Crutched Friars , 
where the tablet to his memory can still be seen .

In his will , which is too long to quote here , Turner bequeathed to his 
wife [65] " his best pece or syluer vessel l and halfe dozen of syluer 
sp one s," and to his nephew " my ly t tell fur red g owne ." Peter , the s on 
to whom he left " all my write n book es and if he be a preach er all my 
diuinitie booke s, & yf he practise Phisicke all my physic ke booke s," 
had some knowledge of plants , for in a copy of Turner's Herbal in the 
Linnean Society 's Library there is a long list of errata for which 
Peter Turner apologised in an Add ress to the Read er. There is 
something very naïve and charm ing about Peter 's admira tion for his 
father 's "fame and estimati on ." He tells us that he has diligent ly 
compared the printed book with his father 's " owne hand e copie ," and 
refrains from having the whole book printed again because "I should 
have done against Charitie to have caused the Printer by that mean es 
to lose all his labor and cost which he hath best owed in printing 
here of . Where fore , gentle Read er, be are a little with the Printer that 
never was much accustomed to the printing of English e and afore thou 
read e over this booke correct it as I haue ap pointed and then the 
profit thereof will abundant ly recompense thy paynes. In the mean e 
time vse this Herbal e in stede of a better and give all laude and 
prayse unto the Lorde ." 

Turner was the first English man who studied plants scientific all y, and 
his herbal mark s the beginning of the science of botany in England . 
Like most writer s of any value , he impressed his personal ity upon his 
books , and these show him to have been a man of in dom it able character , 
caustic wit and in dependent thought . "Vir solidae erudi tion is jud icii" 
he is called by John Ray. His first botanical work was the _Libellus 
de re herb ari a novus_ (1538 ), printed by John By ddell in London . This 
little book is particular ly interesting , because it is the first in 
which localities of native British plants are given . In 15 48 he 
published another small book entitled _The names of herbes in Greke, 
Latin , English e, Duche, and French e wyth the common e names that 
Herb ari es and Apotecaries use , gathered by William Turner _. In the 
preface he tells us that he had begun to " set furth an herbal in 
latyn ," but that when he ask ed the advice of physician s, " their advise 
was that I should e cease from sett ynge out of this boke in latin till 
I had sene those places of England e, where in is moste plentie of 
herbes , that I might in my herbal declare to the great e honou re of our 
countre what numbre of sovereine and stra ng herbes were in England , 
that were not in other nations , whose coun sell I have folo wed , 
deferry ing to set out my herbal in latyn , tyl that I have sene the 
west countre y, which I never sawe yet in al my lyfe , which countre y of 
al places of England , as I he are say , is moste rich e ly replenished 
wyth al kind es of straunge and wonderful l work es and gift es of nature 
as are stones , herbes , fish es and metalles , when as they that mou ed 
me to the sett yng furth of my latin herbal, hear de this so reason able 
an exc use , they moved me to set out an herbal in English e as Fuchs ius 
dyd in latin e wyth the di scription s, figures and properties of as many 
herbes , as I had sene and knew e, to whom I could make no other answer e 
but that I had no such leasure in this vocation and place that I am 
no we in , as is neccessary for a man that should e take in hand e suche 
an in terprise. But thys exc use could e not be admitted for both 
certeine scholars , pot icarie s, and also surgeons , re qui red of me if 
that I would e not set furth my latin herbal, before I have sene the 
west parte s, and have no leasure in thys place and vocation to write 
so great a worke , at the least to set furth my judge ment of the names 
of so many herbes as I knew , whose re quest I have accomp lished, and 
have made a litle boke , which is no more but a table or rege stre of 
suche boke s as I in ten de by the grace of God to set furth here after ; 
if that I may obteine by your grace s heal p such libertie and leasure 
with convenient place , as shall be necessary for suche a purpose ." 

Turner's not able work , his Herbal , is the only original work on botany 
written by any English man in the sixteenth century . The first part of 
it was printed in London by St even Mierd man , a Protestant refugee from 
Antwerp, in 155 1. The second part was printed by Arnold Birck man , at 
Cologne , in 15 61, during Turner's enforced exile. Birck man also 
printed the edition of 1568, which contain ed all three parts . ( For the 
full title , etc., see Bibliography of Herbal s, p. 208.) 

One of the most attractive features of this Herbal is the number of 
beautiful woodcut s with which it is illustrated . A few were special ly 
draw n and cut for the author , but the great majority are reproduc tion s 
of the exquisite drawings in Fuchs 's herbals ( _De historia Stirpium _, 
15 45; and _Neue Kreüterbuch _, 15 43). N early all the illustrations in 
the famous sixteenth- century Flemish, English and Swiss herbals were 
printed from the actual wood-blocks or copied from the illustrations 
in Fuchs 's works . Not ably in Hieronymus Bock 's _Kreüter Buch_ (1546 ), 
Rembert Dodoens 's _Cruÿdtboeck_ (1554 ), Henry Lyte's _Nie we Herball_ 
(1578), and Jean Bauhin 's _Historia plant arum universalis_ (1651). It 
is a remarkable fact that so far as wood -engrav ing is con cerned this 
country has contributed nothing to the art of plant illustration . In 
the first English illustrated Herbal , the _Grete Herball_ of 152 6 , the 
figures are merely copies of the inferior cuts in the later editions 
of the _Herbarius zu Teutsch_ , and , with the exception of Parkinson 's 
_Paradisus_ , all the English sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century 
herbals borrowed their illustrations from Flemish or German source s. 
Fuchs had two set s of blocks for his Herbal , one for the folio edition 
of 15 42 and the other for the octavo edition of 15 45. It was the 
blocks for the latter which were borrowed by Turner's printer , and it 
has been suggested that it was his desire to secure these beautiful 
illustrations which led him to have his herbal printed at Cologne .[66] 
O ver 40 0 of Fuchs 's blocks were used in the complete edition of 
Turner's Herbal , and , of the rest , some are copied from the small er 
figures in Mattioli's[67] commentary on Dioscorides . 

Turner dedicated the first part of his Herbal (1551) to the Duke of 
Somerset, uncle to Edward VI . , and at that time Lord Protector. The 
preface is deli ghtful and I quote a part of it :-- 

"To the mighty and christiane Prince Edward , Duke of 
Summerset, Er le of Her for d , Lorde Beauchampe, and Uncle unto 
the Kynge s maiesty, Wyllyam Turner his servant wysh eth 
increase in the knowledge of God des holy word e and grace to 
ly ue there after . Al though ( most myghty and Christian Prince ) 
there be many noble and excellent act es and science s, which 
no man d out eth but that al myghty God , the author of all 
good ness, hath gyue n unto us by the hands of the He then , as 
necessary unto the use of M an kynd : yet is there none among 
them all , whych is so open ly cōm ended by the ver d it of 
any holy writer in the Bible, as is ye knowledge of plant es, 
herbes , and trees and of Phisick . I do not remembre that I 
have red any e express ed commend at ions of Gramm er, Logick, 
Philosophie, naturall or mor all , Astronomie, Arithmetyke, 
Geometry, Cosmographie, Musycke, Perspectiue or any other 
such lyke science . But I red e among e the commend atyons and 
prayse s of K yng Salomon, that he was sene in herbes shrubbe s 
and trees and so perfect ly that he disputed wyse ly of them 
from the hyghe st to the low est , that is from the Cedre tre 
in Mount Liban unto the Hysop that groweth furth of the 
wall. If the Knowledge of Herbes , shrubbe s and trees which 
is not the lest necessary thynge unto the knowledge of 
Phisicke were not great ly commend able it shulde never have 
bene set among Salomon 's commend acyons and amongst the 
sing ular gift es of God . There for where as Salomon was 
commend ed for the Knowledge of Herbes the same Knowledge was 
express ed ly ynough com̄ ended there also ." Continu ing, he 
speaks of learned English men " Doctor Cle ment , Doctor We ndy 
and Doctor Owen, Doctor Wolt on and Maister Falconer"[68] 
which " have as much knowledge in herbes ye a and more than 
diuerse Italian es and German es whyche have set forth in 
prynt e Herbal les and boke s of simple s. Yet hath none of al 
these set furth any thyng other to the general l profit of 
hole Christ end ome in latin and to the ho nor of thys real me, 
nether in Englysh to the proper profit of their naturall 
countre ." After s ly ly observ ing that perhaps they do not 
care to jeopardise their estimati on , he compares himself , 
for having ven tu red to write this book , with the soldier 
" who is more fr end ly unto the common wealth , which 
adventurous ly run n eth among the myddes of hys enemy es, both 
gyu yng and ta kyng blow es, then he that , whilse other men 
f eight , stand eth in the top of a tre iudg ing how other men 
do , he be ynge without the danger of gonne shot himself ." 

To those who may object that it is too small , he explains that he will 
write more ful ly when he has " travelled diverse shyres in England to 
learn more of the herbs that grow there ." Other s may condemn him for 
writing in English , " for now ( say they ) every man without any study of 
necessary art es unto the knowledge of Phisick will be come a Phisician 
... euery man nay euery old wyfe will presume , not without the mordre 
of many , to prac ty se Phisick ." To these he succinct ly rep lies , " How 
many surgianes and apothecaries are there in England which can 
understand Plini in Latin or Galen and Dioscorides ? " The English 
physician s, he say s, re ly on the apothecaries , and they in turn on the 
old wives who gather the herbs. Moreover, since the physician s are not 
present when their prescriptions are made up, " many a good mā by 
igno rance is put in jeopardy of his life , or good medecine is mar red 
to the great dish one s ty both of the Phisician and of God des worthy 
creatures ." All this can be avoid ed by having a herbal written in 
English . Dioscorides and Galen , he point s out , wrote in their native 
tongue , Greek . "Dyd Dioscorides and Galen give occasion for every old 
wyfe to take in hād the practise of Phisick ? Did they giue any iust 
occasion of murther? If they gaue no occasyon unto every old wyfe to 
practise physike then give I none . If they gave no occasion of murther 
then gyue I none ... then am I no hynder er wr yt ing unto the English my 
countre men an English herball ." 

The second part of Turner's Herbal is dedicated to his old patron , 
Thomas Lord Wentworth , and the complete work , including the third 
part , to Queen Elizabeth .[69] In the preface to this last he re minds 
the queen of a conversation he had had with her in Latin eight e en 
years before , at the Duke of Somerset 's house , when he was physician 
to that noble man . It is in this preface also that he criticises the 
foreign herbalists ; though he has learn t much from them, they had much 
to learn from him , " as their second editions maye testify e." He claim s 
that in the first part of his herbal he taught " the truth of certeyne 
plants which these above - named writer s (Matthiolu s, Fuchs ius , Tragus 
and Dodoneus) either knew not at al or ell is er red in them 
great lye .... And because I would not be lyke unto a cry er yt cry eth a 
lost e horse in the mark eth , and tell eth all the mark es and token s that 
he hath , and yet never sawe the horse , nether could e know e the horse 
if he sawe him : I went e into Italy e and into diverse parte s of 
German y, to know e and se the herbes my selfe ." 

The book owes much of its charm to its vivid descriptions of the 
plants , and the fascinating and unexpected details he gives us about 
them. The comparison of d odd er, for instance, to " a great red harpe 
strynge ," is a happy touch which it is impossible to forget . "Doder 
groweth out of herbes and small bushes as miscel to groweth out of 
trees . Doder is lyke a great red harpe strynge and it wyn d eth about 
herbes f old yng my ch about them and hath floures and knoppe s one from 
an other a good space .... The herbes that I have mark ed doder to growe 
most in are flax and tares ." 

These ac cu rate observ at ions and care ful descriptions are 
characteristic of the writer , and recall similar touch es in the Saxon 
herbals . For example , he records that the stamens of the Madonna lily 
have a different smell from the flower itself , and that the berries of 
the bay tree are almost , but not quite , round . There is only space to 
quote the following :-- 

"The lily hath a long stalk and sel dom more than one , 
how be it it hath som tyme II. It is II or III cu bite s hyghe . 
It hath long leves and som thyng of the fashion of the great 
satyr ion. The flour is exc ed yng white and it hath the for me 
or fashion of a long qui ver , that is to say , smal at the 
one end and by g at the other . The leves of the floures are 
full of c reste s, and the over most ends of the leves bo we a 
little back ward e and from the low est parte with in come forth 
long small yelow thynges lyke thre des of another smelle than 
the floures are of . The roote is round and one pece groweth 
hard to another all moste after the maner of the roote of 
Garleke, but that the cl owes in the lily are broder ." 

"The leaves of the Ba y tree are al wayes grene and in figure 
and fashion they are lyke unto periwincle. They are long and 
brode st in the mid de st of the lefe. They are black is he grene 
name ly when they are old e. They are cur led about the edge s, 
they smell well . And when they are cast en into the fyre they 
crake wonderful ly . The tre in England is no great tre , but 
it thryv eth there many parte s better and is lustier than in 
German y . The berries are all moste round but not altogether. 
The kirnell is cove red with a thick black barke which may 
well be part ed from the kirnell ." 

"B lewbottel groweth in ye corn e, it hath a stalke full of 
corn ers, a narrow and long leefe. In the top of the stalke 
is a knoppy head where upon growe blew e flowers about 
mid summer . The chylde r use to make garlan des of the floure . 
It groweth much among e R ye where fore I think e that good ry 
in an evell and un seas on able yere doth go out of kind e in to 
this wed e." 

"Pennyroyal. -- It c rep eth much upon the ground and hath many 
ly tle round leves not un lyke unto the leves of merierum 
gentil but that they are a little long er and sharp er and 
also litle in dented round e about , and grene r than the leves 
of meriurum a r. The leves grow in litle branch es even from 
the roote of certayn ioyntes by equall space s one de vyded 
from an other . Where as the leves grow in litle tuftes upon 
the over parte s of the braunches .... Penny royal groweth

the he th be side a water y place ." 

Of camomile he writes: " It hath floures wonderful ly 
shyn ynge yellow and resembl ynge the appell of an eye ... the 
herbe may be called in English , golde n floure . It will 
restore a man to hys color short ly yf a man after the long e 
use of the bath e drynk e of it after he is come for the out e 
of the bath . This herbe is scarce in German y but in England 
it is so plenteous that it groweth not only in gardyn es but 
also VI II mi le above London , it groweth in the wylde felde, 
in Rychmonde grene , in Brantfurde grene .... Thy s herb was 
consecrate d by the wyse men of Egypt unto the sonne and was 
rekened to be the only remedy of all agues ." 

Unlike modern authorities , Turner con t ends that our English hyssop is 
the same plant as that mentioned in the Bible, and he also describe s a 
species which does not now exist . " We have in Sumershire be side ye 
cōm ē Hysop that groweth in all other places of England e a kind e 
of Hysop that is al rough e and hor y and it is greater muche and 
strong er then the cōm en Hysop is , som call it rough Hysop ." Another 
plant which seems to have disap pear ed and which , he state s, no other 
writer describe s, is " the wonderful great cole with leaves th rise as 
thike as ever I saw any other cole have . It hath whyte floures and 
round be rryes lyke yvy. This herbe groweth at d ouer harde by the 
Sea-syde. I name it the Douer cole because I founde it first be syde 
Douer ." In cidental ly he mention s samphire also as grow ing at D over . 

It is interesting to find that Turner identifies the _Herba 
Britannica_ of Dioscorides and Pliny ( famed for having cured the 
soldier s of Julius Cæsar of scurvy in the Rhine country ) with 
_Polygonum bistorta _, which he observed plentiful ly in Friesl and , the 
scene of Pliny 's observ at ions . This herb is held by more modern 
authorities to be _Rumex aquations_ ( great water dock ). 

[Illustration: ILLUSTRATIONS FROM TURNER'S " HERBAL "] 

Throughout the Herbal there are re collect ions of the nor th of England , 
where the author spent his boyhood . Of heath , for instance, he tells 
us: "The hy est he the that ever I saw groweth in Northumberland, 
which is so hyghe that a man may hyde himself in ." Of the wild 
hyacinth he writes: "The boy es in Nor thūberl and scrape the roote of 
the herbe and gle w theyr arr owes and boke s wyth that s ly me that they 
scrape of ." Of sea-wrake (seaweed) he tells us: "In the Bishop rich e of 
Durham the hous b and men of the count ie that d wel by the sea syde use to 
fate [fatten, _i. e._ man ure] their land e with seawrake ." Under 
" birch " we find : "Fisherers in Northumberl and pyll off the ut ter most 
barke and put it in the clyft of a stick e and set in fyre and hold it 
at the water syde and make fish come the ther , whiche if they se they 
stryke with theyr leysters or samm on speres. The same ," he continues, 
" is good to make hoopes of and twigges for baskette s, it is so 
bowi nge. It serve th for many good uses and for none better then for 
be tinge of stubborne boy es that eth er lye or will not learn e." 

Cudweed " is called in Northumberl and chafwede because it is thought to 
be good for chaf yng of any man's flesh e wyth go ynge or ry d ynge ." And 
it would be interesting to know if the daisy is still called banwurt 
in the nor th . "The Nor the rn men call thys herbe banwurt because it 
help eth b one s to knyt agayne .... Plini e write th that the dasey hath 
III and some times IV little whyte leves whiche go about the yelow 
knope, it app er eth that the double Daseys were not founde in plinies 
tyme whych have a great e de le mo then Plini maketh mention of ." 

There are other country custom s which he records . "Shepherds use 
cli vers [goosegrass] in stede of a strayn er to pull out here of the 
my lke;" "birderers [bird-catchers] take bowes of birch and lime the 
twigges and go a b at folinge with them ; " " som make a le e [lye] or an 
as hy water of the rotes of gentian w her wyth they toke out spottes very 
well out of cloth ." He mention s wo ad as "trimmed wyth man nes labor in 
dye nge and wull and cloth e ," and teazle " which the full ers dres se 
their cloth wt all ." Appa rent ly Turner gave the spindle tree its name , 
for he says: "I could e never learn e an English e name for it . The 
Du che men call it in Netherlande, spilboo me, that is , spindel tree, 
because they use to make spindel s of it in that countre y, and me 
thy nke it maye be so well named in English sey ing we have no other 
name .... I know no good proper tie that this tree hath , sav ing only it 
is good to make spindel s and brid of cages" [bird cages]. 

The use of complex ion wash es was a custom on which Turner was 
alarm ing ly severe. There are few er beauty recipes in his herbal than 
in any other -- only four altogether. " Some weomen ," we find , "sprinkle 
ye floures of cowslip w{t} whyte wine and after still it and wash 
their face s w{t} that water to drive wrinkles away and to make them 
fayr e in the eyes of the worlde rather then in the eyes of God , whom 
they are not afrayd to off end ." And of mar y gold we learn that "Summe 
use to make theyr here yelow with the floure of this herbe , not be yng 
con tēt with the naturall colour which God hath g even thē ." 

There is curious ly little folk lore in this herbal, and most of it is 
guard ed by " some do say " or " some hold ." Nevertheles s, with this 
qu alificat ion, Turner gives us fragments of folk lore not to be found 
in other herbals . For instance, that nutshells burn t and bound to the 
back of a child 's head will make grey eyes black , and that parsley 
thrown into fish ponds will heal the sick fish es there in . Again , this 
is the first herbal in which any account is to be found of the very 
old custom of curing disease in cattle by bor ing a hole in the ear and 
in s ert ing the herb bear foot.[70] 

" They say it should be used thus. The brode st part of the ear must 
have a round circle made about it w{t} the blood that rinn eth furth 
with a brasen botken and the same circle must be round lyke unto the 
letter O , and when this is done without and in the high er part of the 
ear the halfe of the fore said circle is to be bor ed thoro we with the 
fore said botken and the roote of the herbe is to be put in at the 
hole , when y{t} newe wound e that hath rece y ued it hold eth it so fast , 
that it will not let it go furth , then all the might e and pestilent 
poison of the disease is brought so into the e are . And whilse the part 
which is circle d about e dy eth and fall eth a waye y{t} hole beast is 
sav ed with the lose of a very small parte ." 

Another piece of folk lore is remarkable because it is the only 
instance in an English herbal of a belief in the effect of a human 
being on a plant : "If ye would e fayne have very large and great e 
gourde s, then take sede s that growe there [ in the sides ] .... And let 
weomen nether touch e the yonge gourde s nor loke upon them, for the 
only touch ing e and sighte of weomen kille the yonge gourde s ." This 
belief he quote s from Pliny . 

Turner , again , is the only old herbal is t who refers to the old and 
widespread belief that larch was fire - pro of . It was large ly used , he 
tells us , for lay ing under the tile s of new ly -built house s, as " a sure 
defen ce against burn ing ," and he narrat es at leng th how Julius Cæsar 
was un able to burn a tow er built with larch . On the old mandrake 
legend he is scathing. "The roote s which are count erfited and made 
like litle puppettes and mammettes which come to be sold in England in 
boxes with he ir [hair] and such for me as man hath , are no thyng elles 
but fol is he fened trifles and not naturall . For they are so try mmed of 
craft y the ve s to mo cke the poore people with all and to rob them both 
of theyr wit and theyr money. I have in my tyme at diverse tyme s 
takē up the roote s of mandrake out of the ground e but I never saw 
any such thyng upon or in them as are in and upon the ped l ers roote s 
that are come n ly to be solde in boxes . It groweth not under g all oses 
[gallows] as a certayn do t ing doctor of Colon in his physic k lecture 
dyd teach hys auditors ." But he accepts without quest ion the belief in 
its efficacy as an anæsthetic : " It is given to those who must be 
burn ed or cut in some place that they should not fele the burn ing or 
cut t yng ." Of wine made of it , he says: "If they drynk thys drynk e they 
shall fele no payne, but they shall fall into a forget full and 
slep is he drowsi ness . Of the apple s of mandrake , if a man smell of them 
thei will make hym slepe and also if they be eaten . But they that 
smell to muche of the apple s be come d um ... thys herbe diverse wayes 
taken is very jepardus for a man and may kill hym if he eat it or 
drynk it out of measure and have no remedy from it .... If mandragora 
be taken out of measure by and by slepe en su eth and a great lou sing of 
the stre yng the with a forget ful ness ." 

Turner is one of the few herbalists who caut ions against the exc es s ive 
use of any herb . " On ions eaten in meat large ly make the head ake, they 
make them forget full whiche in the tyme of syknes use them out of 
mesure ." "Cole engendr eth euell and melancholie juice . It dull eth the 
syght and it troubl eth the slepe wyth contrary thynges which are sene 
in the dreme ." Of nigella he writes: "Take he de that ye take not to 
muche of this herbe , for if ye go beyond e the mesure it brynge th 
d eth ." "H emp seed ," he say s, " if it be taken out of measure take th 
men 's wytte s from thē as coriander doth ." "If any person use 
saffr on measu r ably it maketh in them a good colour , but if thei use it 
out of mesure it maketh hym loke pale , and maketh the he de ache and 
hurt eth the appetite ." For those who have taken an over do se of o pium 
there is a surprising remedy . "If the pac ient be to much slep i put 
stynkynge thynges unto hys nose to wake n hym there with ." As in all 
herbals of this period , there are an astonish ing number of remedies 
against melanc holy and suggest ions for those whose we a k brains will 
not stand much strong drink ; but , while remedies for broken heads, so 
common in the older herbals , are conspicuous ly ab sent , we find that 
walnuts are re commend ed " for the by t ing s both of men and dogges " ! 

As in the _Grete Herball_ , there are many descriptions of other 
substance s be sides herbs, some of the long est being of dates , ric e, 
o live s, citron, pomegranates and lentils. The account of citr on it 
would be pleasant to t ran scribe in full , not for the sake of the story 
but for the manner of the tell ing . One could list en to a sermon of 
considerable leng th from a divine who , in a book intended for 
grown - up s, has a tale of " two naughty murther ing robber s, condemn ed 
for theyr murder and robery to be flayn and poysoned to d eth of 
serpent es, and such ven emous best es ," and of the one who , ow ing to 
having eaten " a pece of citron, " remained, Daniel-like, un hurt by the 
poison of the snake s, whilst the other who had not taken this 
pre cau tion " fell down sterk de de ." And final ly , the mor al --" Where fore 
it were wisdome that noble men and other that are by dden to dynner of 
theyr enemies or suspected frendes before they eat any other thyng 
should take a pece of citr on ." 

The later sixteenth- century herbalists owed much to the famous 
herbalists of the Netherl and s, and above all to that prince amongst 
publish ers, Christophe Plantin of Antwerp, whose personal ity secure d 
him a unique place in the literary world . Indeed, there is a splendour 
about the works of the Flemish herbalists unequalled by any others of 
this period , with the exception of the Bavarian doctor Leonhard Fuchs . 
There is no comparison between them and the Italian herbalists of the 
Renaissance, who , for the greater part , dev oted themselves to study ing 
the classical writer s and identify ing the plants mentioned by the old 
authorities . France , curious ly enough , contributed comparative ly 
little when the herbal was at its zenith, though it must of cours e be 
remembe red that the Bauhin s, who ran k as Swiss herbalists , were of 
French extract ion. But it is difficult to estim at e the influence of 
the works of those three not able friend s, Rembert Dodoens , Charles de 
l'Escluse and Matthias de l'Obel , particular ly on the English 
herbalists . The most famous English herbal -- Gerard's -- is virtual ly a 
translation of the _Pemptades_ of Dodoens . Lyte's translation of the 
_Cruÿdtboeck_ was the standard work on herbs during the latter part of 
the century , and Parkinson incorporated a large part of de l'Obel 's 
un finished book in his _Theatrum Botanicum_ . 

De l'Obel , after whom the little garden flower -- lobelia -- is named , 
spent the greater part of his life in England . He was a Flem ing by 
birth and a doctor by profess ion, [71] and he was physician to William 
the Silent until his assassinat ion. A b out 15 6 9 he came over to England 
( with his friend Pena, who at one time was physician to Lou is XIII.) 
and lived at High gate with his son-in-law. He super intended Lord 
Zou che 's garden at Hackney, and later was given the title of botani st 
to James I. L'Obel 's great work , written in collabora tion with Pena, 
was the _ Stirpium Adversaria No va _, printed in London by Thomas 
Purfoot in 15 71 .[72] Pul teney, in his _Biograp hical Sketches_ (1790 ), 
make s the extraordinary state ment that Christophe Plantin of Antwerp 
was the real printer . It has , however, been pointed out by modern 
authorities that the archives of the Plantin Museum show that Plantin 
b ought 800 copies of Purfoot 's edition , with the wood blocks , for 132 0 
florins. In 15 7 6 Plantin published de l'Obel 's _Plant arum seu Stirpium 
historia _, and to this he app ended the first part of the _ Adversaria _, 
keep ing Purfoot 's original colophon. 

Al though Dodoens neither lived in England nor had any of his works 
printed here , his _Cruÿdtboeck_ became one of the standard works in 
this country through Lyte's translation . Dodoens was born at M a lines 
about 15 1 7 and , after study ing at Lou va in , visited the universities 
and medical school s of France , Italy and German y, gra duated M.D. , and 
was ap pointed physician to Maximilian II. and Rudolf II. success ive ly . 
In the latter part of his life he was Professor of Medicine at Leyden, 
where he died in 1 585 . Plantin published Dodoens 's most important 
work , _ Stirpium his to riæ pempta des s ex s ive libri triginta _, in which 
some of the figures are copied from the fifth - century manuscript [73] 
copy of Dioscorides . Dodoens 's first book , the _Cruÿdtboeck_ , was 
translated into French by his friend Charles de l'Escluse [74] and 
after wards into English by Henry Lyte . 

Lyte , who was an Ox for d man , travelled extens ive ly in his youth and 
made a collect ion of r are plants . He contributed nothing original to 
the literature on herbs, but his translation of the French vers ion of 
the _Cruÿdtboeck_ was an inestimable service. His own copy of the 
French vers ion, which is now in the British Museum , has on the 
title-page the quaint in scription " Henry Lyte taught me to speak e 
English e." The book is full of MS. not es and references to Turner . 

The full title of Lyte's book is as follows : "A nie we Herb all or 
Historie of Plantes: where in is con ta yned the whole discourse and 
perfect description of all sort es of Herbes and Plantes: their di vers 
and sun dry kind es : their straunge Figure s, Fashions and Shapes : their 
Name s, Nature s, Opera tion s, and Vertues : and that not only of those 
which are here grow yng in this our Coun tri e of England e but of all 
others also of for rayne Realme s, commonly used in Physicke. First set 
foorth in the D out che or Almaigne tongue by that learned D. Rembert 
Dodoens , Physi tion to the Emper our : And no we first translated out of 
French into English by Henry Lyte Esquyer ." 

(_Colophon._) "I m printed at Antwerp e by Me Henry Loë Book e printer and 
are to be solde at London in Paul 's church yarde by Gerard Dewes."[75] 

The beautiful illustrations in Lyte's _Dodoens_ are to a large extent 
printed from the same blocks as those in the octavo edition (1545) of 
Fuchs . In Fuchs there are about 516 illustrations , and in Lyte's 
_Dodoens_ about 8 70 . Those which are not copied from Fuchs were 
probably collect ed by Dodoens himself , who , accord ing to some verses 
at the beginning of the herbal, took a prac tical interest in the 
publication of the English translation of his book . 

" Till Rembert he did s ende addition s store, 
For to aug ment Lyte's travell past before ." 

The original wood-blocks never came to England , and three years later 
van d er Loë 's widow sold them to Christophe Plantin for 42 0 florins. 

All the commend at ory verses at the beginning of Lyte's herbal are in 
Latin , except some lines in which William Clowes speaks of writing 
about herbs as " a f it occupation for gentle men and wights of worthy 
fame ," and recall s the great men who have immortalised themselves 
there by , notably Gentiu s, Lysimachu s, Mythri dates and Dioscorides . 
Then , after giv ing due praise to Dodoens , "Whose learned skill hath 
of fer ed first this worthy worke to ve we ," Clowes ends with four lines 
in which he play s upon the name of the translator : 

"And Lyte , whose t oyle hath not bene light to dye it in this grayne , 
Deserves no light regard e of us: but thankes and thankes agayne . 
And sure I am all English harte s that lyke of Physi cke s lore 
W ill also lyke this gentle man : and than ke hym muche therefore ." 

The herbal is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth " as the best token of love 
and diligence that I am at this time able to shew .... And doubt less if 
my skill in the translation were answer able to the worthy nesse ey ther 
of the Historie itself e or of the Authours thereof I doubt not but I 
should be thought to haue honou red your Maiestie with an accep table 
present ." The preface is date d from " my poore house at Lyte s carie 
with in your Maiestie s Coun tie of Somerset the first day of Jan uarie 
MDL XXV III. " 

In 160 6 there appear ed the book commonly known as _Ram 's little 
Dodoen_. It purported to be an epitome of Lyte's _Dodoens_ , but , 
though some of its matter has been abridged from Dodoens 's work , it is 
in real ity a compilation of recipes un worthy of the great name it 
bear s. In his preface the author tells us: "I have best owed some tyme 
in re duc ing the most ex qu is it new herball or history of plants ( first 
set forth in Dutch and Almayne tongue by the learned and worthy man of 
famous memory Dr. Rembert Dode on (_sic_) Phisician to the Emper or , and 
translated into English by Master Henry Lyte Esq. ), with a brief and 
short epitome ... so as where the great booke at large is not to be 
had but at a great price , which cannot be pro cured by the poor er 
sort , my en dev or here in hath b in chief ly to make the benefit of so 
good , necessary and profit able a worke to be brought with in the r each 
and compasse as well of you my poore country men and women whose live s, 
health s, ease and welfare is to be regarded with the rest , at a 
small er price than the great volume is . My one ly and greatest care 
hath by n of long tyme to know e or think e how and upon whom e to best ow 
the dedication of this my small labour . And in the penn ing of this my 
letter my Affect ions are satisfied with the dedication thereof to 
these my poore and loving country men who soever and to whose hands 
soever it may come . For whose sake I have desire d publicatiō of the 
same , beseech ing Al mighty God to bless e us all ." 

The book is curious ly arranged, for on one page we have " the practice 
of Dodoen ," and on the opposite " the practise s of others for the same 
Phisike helpe s, collect ed and present ed to the A ut hor of this 
Treatise ." There are direct ions for each month , and each is head ed by 
a motto. The twelve mottoe s, when read together , form the following 
quaint rhyme :-- 

"January. With this fyre I warm e my hand 
February. With this spade I dig ge my land 
March . Here I cut my Vine sp ring 
April . Here I hear the birds sing 
May . I am as fresh as bir d on bough 
Ju ne . Corn is we ed ed well enough 
Ju ly . With this si the my gra sse I mo we 
August. Here I cut my corn e full low e 
Septemb er. With this flaile I ear ne my bread 
Octob er. Here I so we my wheat s so red 
Novemb er. With this axe I kill my swine 
December . And here I brew both ale and wine ." 

There are some things in this little hand book worthy of remembrance, 
notably an imagi native pass age in which the author tells us that 
" herbs that grow in the fields are better than those which grow in 
gardens , and of those herbs which grow in the fielde s, such as grow on 
hill es are best ." 

FOOTNOTES: 

[59] Then "Marie Valence H all ." (F ounded in 13 4 7 by Marie widow of 
Aylmer de Valence , Earl of Pembroke . ) 

[60] It has been suggested that Turner was imprisoned for his refusal 
to sub scribe to the Six Articles and that he recanted to save his 
life . But , as Dr. B. D. Jacks on has pointed out , Turner was made of 
ster ner stuff and his whole life and writings are a stand ing 
con tradic tion to any such sup position . 

[61] One of the earliest botani c gardens in Europe was at Bologna . It 
was found ed by Luca Ghini. It is interesting to see how frequent ly 
Turner in his herbal quote s Ghini, and cites his authority against 
other comm entators. Luca Ghini was the first who erected a se parat e 
profess orial chair at Bologna for Botanical Science. He himself 
lecture d on Dioscorides for twenty- eight years . He was the pre ceptor 
of Caesalp in us and Anquillara, two of the sound est critics on 
botanical writings of that age . 

The most famous public botanical gardens in Europe during the 
sixteenth , seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries were the 
following . I give them in the order in which they were made :-- 

153 3--Padua. 
15 44 -- Florence. 
1547 -- Bologna . 
15 70 -- Paris . 
15 98 -- Montpelli er. 
1628--Jena. 
163 2--Oxford. 
163 7--Upsala. 
1673--Chelsea. 
1675--Edinburgh. 
1677--Leyden. 
1682--Amsterdam. 
1725--Utrecht. 

The first botani c garden in Americ a was found ed in Philadelphia by 
John Bartram, the great Americ an botani st , in the middle of the 
eighteenth century . 

[62] Gesner had a high opinion of Turner , of whom he wrote :-- 

"A nte annos 15 , aut circiter cum Anglicus ex It alia red iens me 
salutaret (Turnerus) is fuer it vir excellent is tum in re medica tum 
ali is plerisque discipl in is doctrinae aut ali us qu is qu am vix s at is 
memini ."-- _De Herb is Lunari is _, 155 5 . 

[63] The Duke of Somerset was himself ke en ly interest ed in botanical 
in vestiga tion s, and Turner frequent ly refers to the Duke 's garden . It 
was during this time that Turner had his own garden at Kew. That he 
s at in the House of Commons is generally supposed from a pass age in 
his _Spiritual Physi k _, and this view is sustained by the character of 
the Hunter in his _Romish Wolfe _. 

[64] It has been as s erted in some account s of Turner that he was a 
Canon of Windsor, but this is a mistake. The Canon of Windsor was 
Richard Turner , also a Protestant , and , like the herbal is t , exiled 
during M ary 's reign . 

[65] Turner's widow subsequently marri ed Richard Cox, who became 
Bishop of E ly . She found ed a scholars hip at Cambridge in memory of her 
first husband. 

[66] It was for the same reason that Henry Lyte's translation of 
Dodoens was printed abroad. 

[67] Pierandrea Mattioli (1501-1577) was physician success ive ly to the 
Archduke Ferd in and and to the Emper or Maximilian II. With the 
exception of Fabio Colon n a he was the greatest of the Italian 
herbalists . 

[68] This was probably the John Falconer who sent English plants to 
Amatus Lusitanu s, who taught physic at Ferrara and Ancona, and whose 
commentary on Dioscorides was published in 155 3. 

[69] Queen Elizabeth 's love of garden ing and her botanical knowledge 
were celebrated in a long Latin poem by an Italian who visited England 
in 15 8 6 and wrote under the name of Melissus (see _A rchæologia _, VI I. 
120 ). 

[70] Parkinson in his _Theatrum Botanicum_ also mention s this use of 
bear foot. 

[71] He studied medicine at Montpelier under Guillaume Rondelet, who 
bequeathed him his botanical manuscripts . D'Aléchamp s, Pena and Jean 
Bauhin , all famous herbalists , were also pupils of Rondelet.
