WILLIAM BLAKE 
There is a certain pathos attached to the fragments from any great wreck and in studying the few Saxon manuscripts treating of herbs which have surviv ed to our day we find their primary fascination not so much in their beauty and interest as in the visions they conjure up of those still older manuscripts which perished during the terrible Danish in vasions 
That books on herbs were studied in England as early as the eighth century is certain for we know that Boni face the Apostle of the Saxons receive d letters from England as king him for books on simple s and complaining that it was difficult to obtain the foreign herbs mentioned in those we already possess ed 
But of these manuscripts none have surviv ed the oldest we possess being of the tenth century and for our knowledge of Anglo Saxon plant lore we look chief ly to those four important manuscripts the Leech Book of Bald the Lacnunga and the Saxon translation s of the Herbarium of Apuleius and the so called 
Apart from their intrinsic fascination there are certain considerations which give these manuscripts a peculiar importance 
Herb lore and folk medicine lag not years but centuries behind the knowledge of their own day 
With in liv ing memory our peasants were us ing and in the most remote parts of these islands they use still the herbal and other remedies of our Saxon ancestors 
They even use curiously similar charms 
The herb lore record ed in these manuscripts is the herb lore not of the century in which they were written but of the dim past ages picture d in the oldest parts of Widsith and Beowulf 
To the student of English plant lore the Herbarium of Apuleius and the are less interesting because they are translation s but the more one studies the original Saxon writings on herbs and their uses the more one realises that just as in Beowulf there are suggestion s and traces of an age far older than that in which the poem was written so in these manuscripts are embedded beliefs which carry us back to the dawn of history 
It is this which gives this plant lore its supreme interest 
It is almost overwhelm ing to recognise that possibly we have here fragments of the plant lore of our ancestors who lived when Attila s hordes were devastat ing Europe and that in the charms and ceremonies connected with the picking and administering of herbs we are carried back to forms of religion so ancient that compared to it the worship of Woden is modern 
Further it is only in these manuscripts that we find this herb lore for in the whole range of Saxon literature out side them there is remarkably little mention of plant life 
The great world of nature it is true is ever present the ocean is the back ground of the acti on in both Beowulf and Cynewulf and the sound of the wind and the sea is in every line 
One is conscious of vast trackless waste s of heath and moor of impenetrable forests and terror in fes ted bogs but of the details of plant life there is scarcely a word 
In these manuscripts alone do we find what plant life meant to our ancestors and as with all primitive nations their belief in the mystery of herbs is almost past our civilised understanding 
Their plant lore hoary with age is redolent of a time when the tribes were still wander ing on the mainland of Europe and in these first record s of this plant lore there is the breath of mighty forests of marsh land s and of Nature in her wildest 
We are swept back to an epoch when man fought with Nature wresting from her the land and when the unseen powers of evil resented this conquest of their domains 
To the early Saxons those unseen powers were an everyday reality 
A super natural terror brooded over the trackless heath s the dark mere pools were inhabi ted by the water elves 
In the wreath ing mist s and driving storm s of s now and hail they saw the uncouth moor gangers the muckle mark steppers who hold the moor s or the stalk ing fiends of the l one ly places creatures whose baleful eyes sh one like flames through the mist 
To this day some of our place names in the more remote parts of these islands recall the memory of those evil terror s 
In these manuscripts we are again in an atmosphere of eotens and trolls there are traces of even older terror s when the first Teuton settlers in Europe struggled with the aborigines who lived in caves hints as elusive as the phantom heroes in the Saxon poem s and as unforgettable 
Still more remarkable is the fact that be neath the superstructure of Christian rites to be used when the herbs were being picked or administe red we find traces not merely of the ancient heathen religion but of a religion older than that of Woden 
It has been emphasised by our most eminent authorities that in very early times our ancestors had but few chief gods and it is a remarkable fact that there is no mention what ever of Woden in the whole range of Saxon literature before the time of Alfred 
In those earlier centuries they seem to have worship ped a personification of Heaven and Earth the wife of Heaven and the S on whom after ages called Thor 
There were also Nature deities Hrede the personification of the bright ness of Sum mer and Eostra the radiant creature of the Dawn 
It will be remembe red that it was the worship not of Bald er but of Eostra which the Christian missionaries found so deep ly imbedded that they adop ted her name and transfer red it to East er 
For this we have the authority of Bede 
Separate from these beneficent powers were the destroy ing and harmful powers of Nature darkness storm frost and the deadly vapours of moor land and fen personified in the giants the ogres the furious witches that rode the wind s and waves in fact the whole horde of demons of sea and land and sky 
It is the traces of these most ancient forms of religion which give to the manuscripts their strongest fascination 
Many of us miss all that is most worth learning in old books through regard ing anything in them that is unfamiliar as merely quaint if not ridiculous 
This attitude seals a book as effectual ly and as permanent ly as it seals a sensitive human being 
There is only one way of understanding these old writer s and that is to for get our s elves entirely and to try to look at the world of nature as they did 
It is not much learning that is requi red but sympathy and imagination 
In the case of these Saxon manuscripts we are repaid a thousandf old for they transport us to an age far older than our own and yet in some way s so young that we have lost its magic key 
For we learn not only of herbs and the end less uses our forefathers made of them but if we try to read them with understanding these books open for us a magic case ment through which we look upon the past bath ed in a glam our of romance 
Our Saxon ancestors may have been a rude and hardy race but they did not live in an age of materialism as we do 
In their writings on herbs and their uses we see as through a glass dark ly a time when grown men believed in elves and goblins as natural ly as they believed in trees an age when it was the belief of everyday folk that the air was peopled with unseen powers of evil against whose machi nations definite remedies must be applied 
They believed as in deed the people of all ancient civilisations have believed that natural forces and natural objects were end ued with mysterious powers whom it was necessary to pro pitiate by special prayer s 
Not only the stars of heaven but springs of water and the simple way side herbs were to them direct ly associa ted with unseen being s 
There are times when one is reminded for cib ly of that worship of Demeter nearer to the Earth which some have thou ght they could discern behind the definite ly national myth ology of Ho mer 
They believed that the sick could be cure d by conjurations and charms as firm ly as we believ e to day in curing them by suggestion is there any real difference between these methods and when one read s the charms which they used in administering their herbs one cannot help wondering whether these were handed down traditional ly from the Sum erians those ancient inhabi tants of Mesopotamia who five thousand years before Christ used charms for curing the sick which have now been partial ly deciphe red from the cuneiform in scription s 
But before studying the plant lore there in contain ed it may be as well to take a preliminary survey of the four most important manuscripts 
The oldest Saxon book deal ing with the virtues of herbs which we possess is the Leech Book of Bald dating from about A D 
Un like some other MS herbals of which only a few tatte red page s remain this perfect specimen of Saxon work has nothing fragile about it 
The vellum is as strong and in as good condition as when it first lay clean and untouched under the hand of the scribe Cild by name who penned it with such skill and loving care 
One s imagination runs riot when one hand les this beautiful book now over a thousand years old and wonders who were its successive owner s and how it has surviv ed the wars and other destructive age ncies through all these centuries 
But we only know that at least for a time it was shelte red in that most romantic of all English monasteries Glastonbury 
This Saxon manuscript has a dignity which is unique for it is the oldest exist ing leech book written in the vernacular 
In a lecture delivered before the Royal College of Physicians in Dr J F Payne com men ted on the remarkable fact that the Anglo Saxons had a much wider knowledge of herbs than the doctor s of Salerno the oldest school of medicine and oldest university in Europe 
No treatise he said of the School of Salerno contemporaneous with the Leech Book of Bald is known so that the Anglo Saxons had the credit of priority 
Their Leech Book was the first medical treatise written in Western Europe which can be said to belong to modern history that is which was produced after the decadence and dec line of the classical medicine which belong s to ancient history 
It seems fair to regard it the Leech Book in a sense as the embryo of modern English medicine and at all even ts the earliest medical treatise produced by any of the modern nations of Europe 
The Anglo Saxons created a vernacular literature to which the continental nations at that time could show no parallel and in the branch of literature connected with medicine in those days based on a knowledge of herbs when it was not magic their position was unique 
Moreover the fact that the Leech Book was written in the vernacular is in itself remarkable for it point s to the existence of a class of men who were not Latin scholars and yet were able and will ing to read books 
The Leech Book belong s to the literary period commonly known as the school of Alfred 
It was probably written short ly after Alfred s death but it is more than probable that it is a copy of a much older manuscript for what is known as the third book of the Leech Book is evidently a short er and older work incorporated by the scribe when he had finished the Leech Book proper 
The book itself was written under the direct ion of one Bald who if he were not a personal friend of King Alfred s had at any rate access to the king s correspondence for one chapter consists of prescriptions sent by Heli as Patriarch of Jerusalem to the king 
We learn the names of the first owner and scribe from lines in Latin verse at the end of the second part of the MS Bald is the owner of this book which he order ed Cild to write Ear nest ly I pray here all men in the name of Christ That no treacherous person take this book from me N either by for ce nor by the ft nor by any false statement 
Why 
Beca use the richest treasure is not so dear to me As my dear books which the Grace of Christ attends 
The book consists of leaves and is written in a large bold hand and one or two of the initial letters are very faint ly illuminated 
The writing is an except ionally fine specimen of Saxon penmanship 
On many of the page s there are mysterious mark s but it is impossible to conjecture their meaning 
It has been sugges ted that they point to the sources from which the book was compiled and were inserted by the original owner 
The Leech Book of Bald was evidently the man ual of a Saxon doctor and he refers to two other doctor s Dun and Oxa by name who had given him prescriptions 
The position of the leech in those days must have been very try ing for he was subject ed to the obviously un fair com petiti on of the high er clergy many of whom enjoyed a reputation for work ing miraculous cures 
The leech being so inferior in position it is not surprising that his medical knowledge did not advance on scientific lines 
He relied on the old heathen superstitions probably from an instinctive feel ing that in pagan religion combined with the herb lore which had been handed down through the ages the mass of the people had a deep rooted faith 
No th ing is more obvious in the Leech Book than the fact that the virtues ascribed to the different herbs are based not on the personal knowledge of the writer but on the old herb lore 
This gives the Leech Book its special fascination for it is the oldest surviv ing manuscript in which we can learn the herb lore of our ancestors handed down to them from what dim past ages we can only surmise 
We have therefore to bear in mind that what may strike our modern mind s as quaint or even grotesque is in the majority of instance s a distor ted form of lore which doubt less suffe red many changes during the early centuries of our era 
N early all that is most fascinating in the Leech Book is of very ancient Indo Germanic or East ern origin but one cannot help wondering how much the Saxons incorporated of the herb lore of the ancient Britons 
Does not Pliny tell us that the Britons gathered herbs with such striking ceremonies that it would seem as though the Britons had taught them to the Persians 
One cannot read Bald s manuscript without being struck by his remarkable knowledge of native plants and garden herbs 
We are inferior to our continental neighbours in so many art s that it is pleasant to find that in the ancient art of garden ing and in their knowledge of herbs our Saxon forefathers excelled 
It has been pointed out by eminent authorities that the Anglo Saxons had names for and used a far large r number of plants than the continental nations 
In the Herbarium of Apuleius including the addition s from Dioscorides only plants are mentioned and this was one of the sta ndard works of the early Middle Ages 
In the Herbarius of the earliest herbal printed in German y only plants are record ed and in the German Herbarius of there are 
But from various sources it has been com put ed that the Anglo Saxons had names for and used at least plants 
One feels instinctive ly that the love of flowers and gardens was as deep rooted in our ancestors as it is in our nati on to day and though we do not know exact ly what they grew in their gardens which they called wyrtyerd literal ly herb yard we do know that the marigold s sun flowers peonies violet s and gil ly flowers which make the cottage gardens of England so gay and full of colour to day were also the common est plants in the Saxon gardens 
Fashions in large gardens have changed through out the centuries and there are state ly gardens in this country famed the world over 
But in regard to our cottage gardens we are staunch ly conservative and it is assu red ly the cottage garden which is character is tical ly English 
Incidentally one cannot help regrett ing that so many of our old Saxon plant names have fall en into dis use 
Waybroad for instance is much more descriptive than plantain which is mislead ing 
Maythen also is sure ly pre fer able to camomile and wergulu is more character istic of that fierce we ed than nettle 
Those of us who are garden ers will certain ly agree that unf ortraedde is the right name for knotweed 
And is not joy of the ground a deli ghtful name for periwinkle 
The oldest illustrated herbal which has come down to us from Saxon times is the translation of the Latin Herbarium Apuleii Platonici 
The original Latin work is believed to date from the fifth century though no copy so ancient as this is in existence now 
The name Apuleius Platonicus is possibly fictitious and nothing is known of the writer who was of course distinct from Apuleius Madaurens is the author of the Golden Ass 
The Saxon translation of this herbal now in the British Museum is supposed to date from A D and belong s to the school of Elfric of Canterbury 
The frontispiece is a colour ed picture in which Pla to is represen ted holding a large volume which is being given him by Esculapius and the Centaur and on the other side of the page is a blue circle spot ted with white and red with in which is the name of the book Herbarium Apuleii Platonici quod accepit ab Escolapio et Chir one centauro magistro Achill is 
The book consists of chapter s in each of which a herb is described and there are accompanying illustration s of the herbs 
Throughout the book there are also remarkable picture s of snakes scorpions and unknown winged creatures 
It has been pointed out that the figures of herbs are obviously not from the original plants but are copied from older figures and these from others older still and one wonders what the original picture s were like 
It is interesting to think that perhaps the illustration s in this Saxon herbal are direct ly descended so to speak from the drawings of Cratevas Dionysius or Metrodorus of whom Pliny tells us They drew the like ness of herbs and wrote under them their effect s 
The picture of the lily is very attractive in spite of the fact that the flowers are painted pale blue 
The sta men s in the figure stand out beyond the petals and look like rays of light with a general effect that is curiously pleas ing 
One of the most interesting figures is that of the mandrake painted in a deep madder which embodies the old legend that it was death to dig up the root and that therefore a dog was tied to a rope and made to drag it up 
It is the opinion of some authorities that these figures show the influence of the school represen ted by the two splen did Vienna manuscripts of Dioscorides dating from the fifth and seventh centuries 
There is no definite evid ence of this and though the illustration s in the Saxon manuscript show the influence of the classical tradition they are poor compared with those in the Vienna manuscript 
To some extent at least the drawings in this herbal must necessari ly have been copies for many of the plants are species unknown in this country 
Illustration ESCULAPIUS PLATO AND A CENTAUR From the Saxon translation of the Herbarium of Apuleius Cott 
V it C folio a The Saxon translation of the Harl 
is a th in volume bad ly mutila ted in parts 
Herr Max Lowenbeck has shown that this is in part translated from a treatise by an eleventh century writer Petrocellus or Petronius of the School of Salerno the original treatise being entitled Practica Petrocelli Salernitani 
As has been pointed out by many eminent authorities the School of Salerno being a surviv al of Greek medicine was uncontamina ted by superstitious medicine 
Consequent ly there are striking difference s between this and the other Saxon manuscripts 
The large majority of the herbs mentioned are those of South ern Europe and the pharmacy is very simple compared with the number of herbs in prescriptions of native origin 
As Dr J F Payne has pointed out Herr Lowenbeck s important discover y does not account for the whole of the English book 
The order of the chapter s differs from that of the Salernitan writer there are passages not to be found in the Practica and in some places the English text gives a full er read ing 
It is fair ly evid ent that the Saxon treatise is at least in part indebted to the Passionarius by Gariopontus another Salernitan writer of the same period 
The Lacnunga Harl 
an original work and one of the oldest and most interesting manuscripts is a small thick volume without any illustration s 
Some of the letters are illuminated and some are rude ly ornamen ted 
At the top of the first page there is the in scription Liber Humfredi Wanley and it is interesting therefore to realise that the British Museum owes this treasure to the zealous antiquarian whose efforts during the closing years of the seventeenth and early years of the eighteenth century resc ued so many valuable Saxon and other MSS 
from oblivi on 
To the student of folk lore and folk custom these sources of herb lore are of remarkable interest for the light they throw on the beliefs and custom s of humble everyday people in Anglo Saxon times 
Of king s and warriors of bards and of great ladies we can read in other Saxon literature and all so vivid ly that we see their halls the long heart hs on which the fires were piled the open ing s in the roof through which the smoke pass ed 
We see the men with their byrnies of ring mail their cres ted helmets their le a ther cove red shields and deadly short swords 
We see them and their women kind wearing golden ornamen ts at their feasts the tables laden with boars flesh and ven is on and chased cups of ale and mead 
We see these same halls at night with the men sleep ing their byrnies and helmets hang ing near them and in the dim light we can make out also the trophies of the chase hang ing on the walls 
We read of their mighty deed s and we know at least something of the ideals and the though ts of their great men and heroes 
But what of that vast number of the human kind who were always in the back ground 
What of the hewers of wood and drawers of water the swineherds the shepherds the carpenters the hedgers and cobblers 
I s it not wonderful to think that in these manuscripts we can learn at least to some extent what plant life meant to these everyday folk 
And even in these days to understand what plant life mean s to the true country man is to get into very close touch with him 
Not only has suburban life separa ted the great concentra ted masses of our people from their birth right of mead ows fields and woods of Nature in her untamed splen d our and mystery most of them have never had so much as a momentary glimpse 
But in Saxon times even the to wns were not far from the unreclaimed marsh es and forests and to the peasant in those days they were full not only of seen but also of unseen perils 
There was probably not a Saxon child who did not know something of the a we of waste places and impenetrable forests 
Even the hamlets lay on the very edge of forests and moor s and to the peasant these were haunted by giant elf and monster as in the more in access ible parts of these islands they are haunted still to those who reta in something of primitive imagination 
And when we study the plant lore of these people we realise that prince and peasant a like used the simple but mysterious herbs not only to cure them of both physical and ment al ill s but to guard them from these unseen monster s 
Of the reverence they paid to herbs we beg in to have some dim apprehensi on when we read of the ceremonies connected with the picking and administering of them 
But first what can we learn of the beliefs as to the origin of disease 
Concern ing this the great bulk of the folk lore in these manuscripts is apparently of native Teuton ic origin or rather it would be more correct to speak of its origin as Indo Germanic for the same doctrines are to be found among all Indo Germanic people s and even in the Vedas notably the Atharva Veda 
Of these beliefs the doctrine of the elf shot occupies a large space the long est chapter in the third book of the Leech Book of Bald being entirely against elf disease 
We know from their literature that to our Saxon ancestors waste places of moor and forest and marsh es were the resort of a host of super natural creatures at enmity with man kind 
In the Leech Book of Bald disease is large ly ascribed to these elves whose shafts produced ill ness in their victims 
We read of be org elfen dun elfen munt elfen 
But our modern word elf feeb ly represen ts these creatures who were more akin to the mark stalk ers to the creatures of darkness with loath some eyes rather than to the fair ies with whom we now associa te the name 
For the most part these elves of ancient times were joy less imperso nations and creatures not of sun but of darkness and winter 
In the gloom and solitude of the forest where the bitter wormwood stood pale grey and where the hoar stones lay thick the black giant elves had their dwelling 
They claim ed the forest for their own and ha ted man because bit by bit he was wresting the forest from them 
Yet they made for man those mystic swords of super human work man ship engraved with magic runes and dipped when red hot in blood or in a broth of poisonous herbs and twigs 
We do not understand we can only ask why did they make them 
What is the meaning of the myth 
The water elves recall the sea monster s who attended Grendel s dam imperso nations of the fury of the waves akin to Hnikarr and again other water elves of the cavernous bed of ocean primeval deadly creatures inhabi ting a like the sea and the desolate fen s where the elk s edge waxed in the water 
If some were akin to the For mori of the baleful fogs in Irish myth ic history and the Mallt y nos those she demons of marsh y land s immortalised by the We lsh bards creatures huge and uncouth with grey and gla ring eyes there were others who exceeded in beauty anything human 
When Cedm on wrote of the beauty of Sarah he described her as sheen as an elf 
With the pass ing of the centuries we have well nigh for gotten the black elves though they are still real it ies to the Highlander and too real for him to speak of them 
But have we not the descendant s of the sheen bright elves in the works of Shakespeare Milt on and Shelley 
One feels very sure that our Saxon ancestors would have under stood that glittering elf Ariel as few of us are cap able of understanding him 
He is the old English bright elf 
Did not Prospero sub due him with magic as our ancestors used magic song s in administering herbs to quell the elf 
Here is one such song from the Leech Book of Bald and at the end a conjurati on to bury the elf in the earth 
I have wreath ed round the wound s The best of heal ing wreath s That the baneful sores may N either burn nor burst Nor find their way further Nor turn foul and fallow 
Nor thump and throle on Nor be wicked wound s Nor dig deep ly down But he himself may hold In a way to health 
Let it ache thee no more Than ear in Earth ache th 
Sing also this many times May earth bear on thee with all her might and main 
Leech Book of Bald III 

This was for one in the water elf disease and we read that a person so afflic ted would have liv id nails and tea rful eyes and would look down wards 
Amongst the herbs to be administe red when the charm was sung over him were a yew berry lupin helenium marsh mallow dock elder wormwood and straw berry leaves 
Goblins and nightmare were regarded as at least akin to elves and we find the same herbs were to be used against them betony being of peculiar efficacy against monstrous nocturnal visions and against fri ghtful visions and dreams 
The malicious elves did not con fine their attacks to human being s references to elf shot cattle are numerous 
I quote the following from the chapter against elf disease 
For that ilk i 
e for one who is elf shot 
Go on Thurs day even ing when the sun is set where thou know est that helenium stand s then sing the Benedicite and Pater Noster and a litany and stick thy knife into the wort make it stick fast and go away go again when day and night just divide at the same period go first to church and cross thyself and commend thyself to God then go in silence and though anything soever of an awful sort or man meet thee say not thou to him any word ere thou come to the wort which on the even ing before thou mark ed st then sing the Benedicite and the Pater Noster and a litany delve up the wort let the knife stick in it go again as quick ly as thou art able to church and let it lie under the altar with the knife let it lie till the sun be up wash it afterwards and make into a drink with bishopwort and lichen off a crucifix boil in milk thrice thrice pour holy water upon it and sing over it the Pater Noster the Credo and the Gloria in Excels is Deo and sing upon it a litany and score with a s word round about it on three sides a cross and then after that let the man drink the wort So on it will be well with him 
Leech Book III 

The instruction s for a horse or cattle that are elf shot runs thus If a horse or other neat be elf shot take sorrel seed or Scotch wax let a man sing twelve Masses over it and put holy water on the horse or on what soever neat it be have the worts always with thee 
For the same take the eye of a broken needle give the horse a prick with it no harm shall come 
Leech Book of Bald I 

An other prescription for an elf shot horse runs thus If a horse be elf shot then take the knife of which the ha ft is the horn of a fallow ox and on which are three brass nails then write upon the horse s for ehead Christ s mark and on each of the limb s which thou mayst feel at then take the left ear prick a hole in it in silence this thou shalt do then strike the horse on the back then will it be whole And write upon the hand le of the knife these words Benedicite omnia opera Domini dominum 
Be the elf what it may this is mighty for him to amend 
Leech Book of Bald I 

Closely all ied to the doctrine of the elf shot is that of flying venom 
It is of course possible to regard the phrase as the graphic Anglo Saxon way of describing infectious disease s but the various synonymous phrase s the on flying things the loathed things that rove through the land sugges t something of more malignant acti vity 
As a recent lead ing article in The Times show s we are as a matter of fact not much wiser than our Saxon ancestors as to the origin of an epidemic such as influenza 
In deed to talk of catch ing a cold or any infectious disease would have struck an Anglo Saxon as ludicrous man kind being rather the victims of flying venom 
In the alliterative lay in the Lacnunga part of which is given below the wind is described as blow ing these venom s which produced disease in the bodies on which they light ed their evil effect s being subsequent ly blown away by the magic ian s song and the efficacy of salt and water and herbs 
This is general ly supposed to be in its origin a heathen lay of great antiquity preserve d down to Christian times when allusions to the new religion were inserted 
It is written in the We ssex dialect and is believed to be of the tenth century but it is undoub ted ly a reminisc ence of some far older lay 
The lay or charm is in praise of nine sacred herbs one a tree mugwort waybroad plantain s time water cres s atterlo the 
may then camomile wergulu nettle crab apple chervil and fennel 
These nine attack against nine venom s 
A worm came creep ing he to re as under a man 
Then took Woden nine magic twigs then smote the serpent that he in nine bit s dispersed 
Now these nine herbs have power against nine magic out casts against nine venom s against nine flying things have might against the loathed things that over land rove 
Against the red venom s against the runlan 
venom against the white venom against the blue 
venom against the yellow venom against the green venom against the du sky venom against the brown venom against the purple venom 
Against worm blast against water blast against thorn blast against thistle blast Against ice blast Against venom blast 






if any venom come flying from east or any come from north or any from south or any from we st over man kind I alone know a running river and the nine serpent s be hold it All weeds must now to herbs give way Sea s dissolve and all salt water when I this venom from thee blow 
In the chapter in the Leech Book of Bald contain ing the prescriptions sent by the Patriarch of Jerusalem to King Alfred we find among the virtues of the white stone that it is power ful against flying venom and against all uncouth things and in another pass age that these venom s are particular ly dangerous fifteen nights ere Lammas and after it for five and thirty nights leech es who were wisest have taught that in that month no man should any where we aken his body except there were a necessity for it 
In the most ancient source of Anglo Saxon medicine the Lacnunga we find the following salve for flying venom A salve for flying venom 
Take a handful of ham mer wort and a handful of may the camomile and a handful of waybroad plantain and root s of water dock seek those which will float and one eggshell full of clean honey then take clean butter let him who will help to work up the salve melt it thrice let one sing a mass over the worts before they are put together and the salve is wrought up 
But it is in the doctrine of the worm as the ultimate source of disease that we are carried back to the most ancient of sagas 
The drag on and the worm the supreme ene my of man which play so dominat ing a part in Saxon literature are here set down as the source of all ill 
In the alliterative lay in the Lacnunga the open ing lines describe the war between Woden and the Serpent 
Disease a rose from the nine fragments into which he smote the serpent and these disease s blown by the wind are counterac ted by the nine magic twigs and salt water and herbs with which the disease is again blown away from the victim by the power of the magic ian s song 
This is the atmosphere of the great earth worm Fafnir in the Volsunga Saga and the drag on in all folk tales the great beast with whom the heroes of all nations have contended 
Further it is noteworthy that not only in Anglo Saxon medicine but for many centuries afterwards even mi nor ailments were ascribed to the pre s ence of a worm notably toothache 
In the Leech Book we find toothache ascribed to a worm in the to oth see Leech Book II 

It is impossible in a book of this size to deal with the comparative folk lore of this subject but in pass ing it is interesting to recall an incantation for toothache from the Babylonia n cuneiform text s in which we find perhaps the oldest example of this belief 
The Marshes created the Worm Came the Worm and we pt before Shamash What wilt thou give me for my food 
What wilt thou give me to devour 







Let me drink among the teeth And set me on the gums That I may devour the blood of the teeth And of the gums destroy their strength 
Then shall I hold the bolt of the door 







So must thou say this O Worm May E a smite thee with the might of his fist 
Closely in ter wo ven with these elements of Indo Germanic origin we find the ancient East ern doctrine which ascribes disease to demoniac possession 
The exorcisms were original ly heathen charms and even in the Leech Book there are many interesting surviv al s of these although Christian rites have to a large extent been substituted for them 
Both mandrake and periwinkle were supposed to be end owed with mysterious powers against demoniac al possession 
At the end of the description of the mandrake in the Herbarium of Apuleius there is this prescription For wit less ness that is devil sickness or demoniac al possession take from the body of this same wort mandrake by the we ight of three pennies administe r to drink in warm water as he may find most convenient soon he will be heal ed Herb 
Ap 
Of periwinkle we read This wort is of good advant age for many purposes that is to say first against devil sickness and demoniac al possession s and against snakes and wild beast s and against poisons and for various wishes and for envy and for terror and that thou mayst have grace and if thou hast the wort with thee thou shalt be prosperous and ever accept able 
This wort thou shalt pluck thus say ing I pray thee vinca per vinca thee that art to be had for thy many use ful qualities that thou come to me glad blossom ing with thy main ful ness that thou out fit me so that I be shielded and ever prosperous and undamaged by poisons and by water when thou shalt pluck this wort thou shalt be clean of every un clean ness and thou shalt pick it when the moon is nine nights old and el even nights and thirteen nights and thirty nights and when it is one night old Herb 
Ap Illustration MANDRAKE FROM A SAXON HERBAL Sloane folio a In the treatment of disease we find that the material remedies by which I mean remedies devoid of any mystic meaning are with few exception s entirely herbal 
The herb drink s were made up with ale milk or vinegar many of the potions were made of herbs mixed with honey and ointments were made of herbs work ed up with butter 
The most scientific prescription is that for a vapour bath and there are suggestion s for what may be come fashion able once more herb bath s 
The majority of the prescriptions are for common ailments and one cannot help being struck by the number there are for broken head s bleed ing nose s and bite s of mad dog s 
How ever ignorant one may be of medicine it is impossible to read these old prescriptions without real is ing that our ancestors were an un commonly hardy race for the majority of the remedies would k ill any of us modern we akl ing s even if in robust health when they were administe red 
At times one cannot help wondering whether in those days as not in frequently happens now the bul let in was issued that the opera t ion was quite success ful but the patient died of shock 
And as further evid ence of the old truth that there is nothing new under the sun it is pleasant to find that doctor s even in Saxon days prescribed carri age exercise and more over endeavoured to sweet en it by all ow ing the patient to lap up honey first 
This prescription runs thus Against want of appetite 
Let them after the night s fast lap up honey and let them seek for themselves fatigue in riding on horse back or in a wain or such conveyance as they may endure 
Leech Book II 

In the later herbals beauty recipes are as is well known a conspicuous feature but they find a place also in these old manuscripts 
In the third book the oldest part of the Leech Book there is a prescription for sun burn which runs thus For sun burn boil in butter tender ivy twigs smear there with 
Leech Book III 

And in Leech Book II 
we find this prescription That all the body may be of a clean and glad and bright hue take oil and dregs of old wine equal ly much put them into a mortar mingle well together and smear the body with this in the sun 
Leech Book II 

Pre scription s for hair fall ing off are fair ly numerous and there are even two somewhat drastic prescriptions for hair which is too thick 
So w bread and water cres s were both used to make hair grow and in Leech Book I there is this prescription If a man s hair fall off work him a salve 
Take the mickle wolf s bane and viper s bugloss and the netherward part of bur dock work the salve out of that wort and out of all these and out of that butter of which no water hath come 
If hair fall off boil the polypody fern and foment the head with that so warm 
In case that a man be bald Plinius the mickle leech saith this leechdom Take dead bees burn them to ashes add oil upon that see the very long over gledes then strain w ring out and take leaves of will ow pound them pour the juice into the oil boil again for a while on gledes strain them smear there with after the bath 
Leech Book I 

The two prescriptions for hair which is too thick are in the same chapter In order that the hair may not wax take emmet s eggs rub them up smudge on the place never will any hair come up there 
Again if hair be too thick take a swal low burn it to ashes under a tile and have the ashes shed on 
There are more pro visions against disease s of the eye than against any other com plaint and it is probably because of the pre val ence of these in old en days that we still have so many of the superstitions connected with springs of water 
Both may then camomile and wild let tuce were used for the eyes 
In the following for mistiness of eyes there is a touch of pathos For mistiness of eyes many men l est their eyes should suffe r the disease look into cold water and then are able to see far 
The eyes of an old man are not sharp of s ight then shall he wake up his eyes with rub b ing s with wal king s with riding s either so that a man bear him or convey him in a wain 
And they shall use little and care ful meat s and comb their head s and drink wormwood before they take food 
Then shall a salve be wrought for unsharpsigh ted eyes take pep per and be at it and a somewhat of salt and wine that will be a good salve 
One prescription is unique for the herb which one is direct ed to use is not to be found in any other herbal in existence 
This is rind from Paradise 
There is a grim humour about the scribe s com ment and one cannot help wondering what was the origin of the prescription Some teach us against bite of add er to speak one word faul 
It may not hurt him 
Against bite of snake if the man pro cures and eat eth rind which cometh out of Paradise no venom will hurt him 
Then said he that wrote this book that the rind was hard gotten 
These manuscripts are so full of word picture s of the treatment of disease that one feels if one were transport ed back to those days it would in most cases be possible to tell at a gla nce the cures various people were under go ing 
Let us visit a Saxon ham let and go and see the sick folk in the cottage s 
On our way we meet a man with a fawn s skin decora ted with little bunches of herbs dangl ing from his should ers and we know that he is a suffe rer from nightmare 
An other has a wreath of c love wort tied with a red th read round his neck 
He is a lunatic but as the moon is on the wane his family hope that the wearing of these herbs will prove be neficial 
We enter a dark one room ed hut the dwelling of one of the swineherds but he is not at his work for it seem ed to him that his head turned about and that he was far ing with turned brains 
He had consul ted the leech and suggestion cures being then rather more common than now the leech had advised him to s it calmly by his fire side with a linen cloth wrung out in spr ing water on his head and to wait till it was dry 
He does so and to quote the words with which nearly all Saxon prescriptions end we feel it will soon be well with him 
Let us w end our way to the cobbler a sullen taci turn man who find s his live ly young wife s chatter unendurable 
We find him look ing more gloom y than usual for he has eaten nothing all day and now s its moodi ly consum ing a raw radish 
But there is purpose in this 
Does not the ancient leechdom say that if a radish be eaten raw after fast ing all day no woman s chatter the next day can annoy 
In another cottage we find that a patient suffe ring from elf shot is to be smoke d with the fumes of herbs 
A huge quern stone which has been in the fire on the hear th all day is drag ged out the prepared herbs w all wort and mugwort are scattered upon it and also under neath then cold water is pour ed on and the patient is reeked with the steam as hot as he can endure it 
Smoking sick folk especially for demoniac possession is a world wide practice and of very ancient origin 
There is no space here to attempt to touch on the comparative folk lore of this subject 
Moreover fumigating the sick with herbs is closely akin to the burn ing of incense 
Even in ancient Babylonia n days fumigating with herbs was practised 
It was very common all through the Middle Ages in most parts of Europe and that it has not even yet died out is shown by the extract from The Times given below 
I have purpose ly put in juxta position the translation of the ancient Babylonia n tablet and the extract from The Times 
It is noteworthy that not only human being s but cattle and swine were smoke d with the fumes of herbs 
In the Lacnunga for sick cattle we find Take the wort put it upon gledes and fennel and hassuck and cotton and incense 
Burn all together on the side on which the wind is 
Make it reek upon the cattle 
Make five cross es of hassuck grass set them on four sides of the cattle and one in the middle 
Sing about the cattle the Benedicite and some litanies and the Pater Noster 
Sprinkle holy water upon them burn about them incense and cotton and let some one set a value on the cattle let the owner give the tenth penny in the Church for God after that leave them to amend do this thrice 
Lacnunga 
To preserve swine from sudden death sing over them four masses drive the swine to the fold hang the worts upon the four sides and upon the door also burn them add ing incense and make the reek stream over the swine 
Lacnunga 
Herb s used as amulets have always played a conspicuous part in folk medicine and our Saxon ancestors used them as all ancient race s have used them not merely to cure definite disease s but also as protection against the unseen powers of evil to preserve the eyes ight to cure lunacy against we ari ness when go ing on a journey against being barked at by dog s for safety from robbers and in one prescription even to restore a woman stricken with speech less ness 
The use of herbs as amulets to cure disease s has almost died out in this country but the use of them as charms to en sure good luck surviv es to this day notably in the case of white heath er and four leave d cl over 
There is occasional ly the instruction to bind on the herb with red wool 
For instance a prescription against head ache in the third book of the Leech Book enjoins bind ing waybroad which has been dug up without iron before sunrise round the head with a red fil let 
Binding on with red wool is a very ancient and widespread custom 
Red was the colour sacred to Thor and it was also the colour abhor red not only by witches in particular but by all the powers of darkness and evil 
An ancient Ass yr ian eye charm pre scribe s bind ing pure strands of red wool which have been brought by the pure hand of on the right hand and down to quite recent times even in these islands ty ing on with red wool was a common custom 
Be sides their use as amulets we also find instruction s for hang ing herbs up over door s etc for the be nefit not only of human being s but of cattle also 
Of mugwort we read in the Herbarium of Apuleius And if a root of this wort be hung over the door of any house then may not any man dam age the house 
Of Crot on oil plant 
For hail and rough we a ther to turn them away 
If thou hast in thy possession this wort which is named ricinus and which is not a native of England if thou hang est some seed of it in thine house or have it or its seed in any place what soever it turn eth away the tempestuous ness of hail and if thou hang est its seed on a ship to that degree wonderful it is that it smootheth every tempest 
This wort thou shalt take say ing thus Wort ricinus I pray that thou be at my song s and that thou turn away hail s and light n ing bolt s and all tempest s through the name of Al mighty God who hight thee to be produced and thou shalt be clean when thou pluck est this herb Herb

Lacnunga 
The herbs in common est use as amulets were betony vervain peony yarrow mugwort and waybroad plantain 
With the exception of vervain no herb was more high ly prized than betony 
The treatise on it in the Herbarium of Apuleius is supposed to be an abridged copy of a treatise on the virtues of this plant written by Antonius Musa physician to the Emperor Augustus 
No few er than twenty nine uses of it are given and in the Saxon translation this herb is described as being good whether for a man s soul or his body 
Vervain was one of the herbs held most sacred by the Druid s and as the herbals of Gerard and Parkinson testify it was in high repute even as late as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries 
It has never been satisfactori ly identified though many authorities in c line to the belief that it was verbena 
In Dr uidical times libations of honey had to be of fer ed to the earth from which it was dug mystic ceremonies attended the digging of it and the plant was lif ted out with the left hand 
This uprooting had always to be per formed at the ri sing of the dog sta r and when neither the sun nor the moon was shining 
Why the humble waybroad should occupy so pro minent a place in Saxon herb lore it is difficult to understand 
It is one of the nine sacred herbs in the alliterative lay in the Lacnunga and the epithets mother of worts and open from east wards are applied to it 
The latter curious epithet is also applied to it in Lacnunga which spreadeth open to wards the East 
Waybroad has certain ly wonderful ly curative powers especially for be e stings but other wise it has long since fall en from its high e state 
Peony through out the Middle Ages was held in high repute for its pro tect ive powers and even during the closing years of the last century country folk hung be ads made of its root s round children s neck s 
Yarrow is one of the ab original English plants and from time immemorial it has been used in incantation s and by witches 
Country folk still regard it as one of our most valuable herbs especially for rheumatism 
Mug wort which was held in repute through out the Middle Ages for its efficacy against unseen powers of evil is one of the nine sacred herbs in the alliterative lay in the Lacnunga where it is described thus Eldest of worts Thou hast might for three And against thirty For venom availest For flying vile things Mighty against loathed one s That through the land rove 
Harl e ian MS 
Illustration ARTEMISIA AND BLACKBERRY FROM A SAXON HERBAL Sloane folio a With the not able exception of vervain it is curious how little pro m in ence is given in Saxon plant lore to the herbs which were held most sacred by the Druid s and yet it is scarcely c red ible that some of their wonderful lore should not have been assimila ted 
But in these manuscripts little or no importance attaches to mistletoe holly birch or ivy 
There is no mention of mistletoe as a sacred herb 
We find some mention of selago general ly identified with ly copodium selago of which Pliny tells us vague ly that it was like sav in 
The gather ing of it had to be accompanied in Druid days with mystic ceremonies 
The Druid had his feet bare and was clad in white and the plant could not be cut with iron nor touch ed with the naked hand 
So great were its powers that it was called the gift of God 
Nor is there any mention in Saxon plant lore of the use of sorbus aucuparia which the Druid s plant ed near their monolithic circle s as protection against unseen powers of darkness 
There is however one prescription which may date back to the Roman occupati on of Britain 
It runs thus Take nettle s and see the them in oil smear and rub all thy body there with the cold will depart away 
It has always been believed that one of the varieties of nettle Urtica pilulifera was introduced into England by the Roman soldiers who brought the seed of it with them 
According to the tradition they were told that the cold in England was unendurable so they brought these seed s in order to have a plentiful supp ly of nettle s where with to rub their bodies and there by keep themselves warm 
Possib ly this prescription dates back to that time 
From what hoary antiquity the charms and incantation s which we find in these manuscripts have come down to us we cannot say 
Their atmosphere is that of pale olithic cave drawings for they are redolent of the craft of sorcerers and they sugges t those st range cave mark ing s which no one can deciphe r 
Who can say what lost language s are embedded in these unintelligible words and sing le letters or what is their meaning 
To what ancient ceremonies do they per ta in and who were the initiated who alone under stood them 
At present it is all mysterious though perhaps one day we shall discover both their sources and their meaning 
They show no definite traces of the Scandinavian rune lay s concerning herbs though one of the charms is in runic character s 
It is noteworthy that in the third book which is evidently much older than the first two parts of the Leech Book the pro porti on of heathen charms is except ionally large 
In one prescription we find the names of two heathen idols Tiec on and Leleloth combined with a later Christian in terpolati on of the names of the four gospellers 
The charm is in runic character s and is to be followed by a prayer 
Many of the mystic sent ence s are w holly in com pre hens ible in others we find heathen names such as Lilumenne in others a str ing of words which may be a corrupt form of some very ancient language 
Thus a lay to be sung in case a man or beast drink s an in sect runs thus Gonomil org omil marbumil marbsai t of eth etc 
If some of the charms have a malignant sound others were probably as so oth ing in those days as those gems are still which have surviv ed in our inimitable nursery rhymes 
For instance the following has for us no meaning but even in the translation it has something of the curious effect of the words in the original 
A woman who cannot rear her child is instructed to say E very where I carried for me the famous kind red doughty one with this famous meat doughty one so I will have it for me and go home 
In the Lacnunga there is a count ing out charm which is a mixture of an ancient heathen charm combined with a Christian rite at the end 
Nine were No ddes sisters then the nine came to be eight and the eight s even and the s even six and the six five and the five four and the four three and the three two and the two one and the one none 
This may be medicine for thee from scrofula and from worm and from every m is chief

Lacnunga 
Of the world wide custom of charm ing disease from the patient and transfer ring it to some inanimate object we find numerous example s 
This custom is not only of very ancient origin but persis ted until recent times even in this country 
As commonly practised in out of the way parts of Great Britain it was believed that the disease transfer red to an inanimate object would be contrac ted by the next person who picked it up but in the Saxon herbals we find an apparently older custom of transfer ring the disease to running water sugges tive of the Israelitish scapegoat and also that of throw ing the blood from the wound a cross the wagon way 
These charms for transfer ring disease seem original ly to have been associa ted with a consider able amount of ceremonial 
For instance in those to cure the bite of a hunting spider we find that a certain number of scarifications are to be struck and in both cases an odd number three and five in the case of the five scarifications one on the bite and four round about it the blood is to be caught in a green spo on of hazel wood and the blood is to be throw n in silence over a wagon way 
In the Lacnunga there are traces of the actual ceremonial of transfer ring the disease and the Christian prayer has obviously been substituted for an older heathen one 
The charm is in unintelligible words and is followed by the instruction Sing this nine times and the Pater Noster nine times over a barley loaf and give it to the horse to eat 
In a salve against the elf in race it is not ice able that the herbs after elabo rate pre parati on are not administe red to the patient at all but are throw n into running water 
A salve against the elf in race and nocturnal gobl in visit or s take wormwood lupin 
Put these worts into a vessel set them under the altar sing over them nine masses boil them in butter and sheep s grease add much holy salt strain through a cloth throw the worts into running water

One charm in the Lacnunga which is perhaps not too long to quote speak s of some long lost tale 
It appear s to be a frag ment of a popular lay and one wonders how many count less generations of our ancestors sang it and what it com memorates Loud were they loud as over the land they rode Fierce of heart were they as over the hill they rode

Nor is the mystery of number s lac king in these herbal prescriptions particular ly the number s three and nine 
In the alliterative lay of the nine heal ing herbs this is very conspicuous 
Woden we are told smote the serpent with nine magic twigs the serpent was broken into nine parts from which the wind blew the nine flying venom s 
There are numerous instance s of the patient being direct ed to take nine of each of the ing red ients or to take the herb poti on itself for three or nine days 
Or it is direct ed that an incantation is to be said or sung three or nine times or that three or nine masses are to be sung over the herbs 
This mystic use of three and nine is conspicuous in the following prescription Against dysentery a bramble of which both ends are in the earth take the new er root delve it up cut up nine chips with the left hand and sing three times the Miserere mei De us and nine times the Pater Noster then take mugwort and ever last ing boil these three worts and the chips in milk till they get red then let the man sip at night fast ing a pound dish full let him rest himself s oft and wrap himself up warm if more need be let him do so again if thou still need do it a third time thou wilt not need of tener

Some of the most remarkable passages in the manuscripts are those concerning the ceremonies to be observed both in the picking and in the administering of herbs 
What the mystery of plant life which has so deep ly affec ted the mind s of men in all ages and of all civilisations meant to our ancestors we can but dim ly appreh end as we study these ceremonies 
They carry us back to that worship of earth and the forces of Nature which pre vailed when Woden was yet unborn 
That Woden was the chief god of the tribes on the mainland is in dis put able but even in the hierarchy of ancestors reverence d as semi divine the Saxons themselves look ed to Sceaf rather than to Woden who himself was descended from Sceaf

There is no tang ible link between his descendant Woden and the worship of earth but the sheaf of corn the symbol of Sceaf carri es us stra ight back to Nature worship 
Sceaf take s his fitt ing place as the semi divine ancestor with the less er divinities such as Hrede and Eostra goddess of the radiant dawn 
It is to this age that the ceremonies in the picking of the herbs transport us to the mystery of the virtues of herbs the fertility of earth the never ce as ing conflict between the beneficent forces of sun and summer and the evil powers of the long dark north ern winter s 
Closely in tertwined with Nature worship we find the later Christian rites and ceremonies 
For the new teach ing did not oust the old and for many centuries the mind of the aver age man hal ted hal f way between the two faith s 
If he accept ed Christ he did not cease to fear the great hierarchy of unseen powers of Nature the worship of which was b red in his very bone 
The ancient festivals of Yule and Eostra continued under another guise and polytheism still held its s way 
The devil became one with the gloom y and terrible in Nature with the malignant elves and dwarf s 
Even with the war fare between the beneficent powers of sun and the fertility of Nature and the malignant powers of winter the devil became associa ted 
Nor did men cease to believ e in the Wyrd that dark ultimate fate goddess who though obscure lies at the back of all Saxon belief 
It was in va in that the Church preached against superstitions 
Egbert Archbishop of York in his Penitential strict ly forbade the gather ing of herbs with incantation s and enjoined the use of Christian rites but it is probable that even when these manuscripts were written the majority at least of the common folk in these islands though nominal ly Christian had not deser ted their ancient way s of thou ght 
When the Saxon peasant went to gather his heal ing herbs he may have used Christian prayer s and ceremonies but he did not for get the goddess of the dawn 
It is noteworthy how frequently we find the in junction that the herbs must be picked at sunrise or when day and night divide how of ten stress is laid upon look ing to wards the east and turn ing as the sun go eth from east to south and we st 
In many there is the instruction that the herb is to be gathered without use of iron or with gold and with h art s horn emblems of the sun s rays 
It is curious how little there is of moon lore 
In some cases the herbs are to be gathered in silence in others the man who gather s them is not to look behind him a pro hibition which occurs frequently in ancient superstitions 
The ceremonies are all mysterious and sugges tive but behind them always lies the ancient in eradic able worship of Nature 
To what dim past does that cry Erce Erce Erce Mother of Earth carry us 
Erce Erce Erce Mother of Earth 
May the All Wi elder Ever Lord grant thee A cres a wax ing up wards a grow ing Pre gnant with corn and plenteous in strength Hosts of grain shafts and of glittering plants 
Of broad barley the blossom s And of white wheat ear s wax ing Of the whole earth the harvest 
Let be guard ed the grain against all the ill s That are s own o er the land by the sorcery men Nor let cunning women change it nor a craft y man 
And that other ancient verse Hail be thou Earth Mother of men 
In the lap of the God be thou a grow ing 
Be fil led with fodder for fare need of men 
It is of these two invocations that Stopford Brooke whose translation s I have used writes These are very old heathen invocations used I daresay from century to century and from far pre his to ric times by all the Teuton ic far mer s 
Who Erce is remain s obscure 
But the Mother of Earth seems to be here meant and she is a person who great ly kind les our curiosity 
To touch her is like touch ing empty space so far away is she 
At any rate some God head or other seems here set forth under her proper name 
In the Nor the rn Cosmogony N ight is the Mother of Earth 
But Erce cannot be N ight 
She is if Erce be a proper name bound up with agriculture 
Grimm sugges ts Eorce connected with the Old High German erchan simple x 
He also make s a bold guess that she may be the same as a divine dam e in Low Saxon districts called He rke or Harke who dispenses earth ly good s in abundance and acts in the same way as Berhta and Holda an earth goddess the lady of the ploug her and sower and re a per 
In the Mark she is called Frau Harke 
Montanus draw s attenti on to the appearance of this charm in a convent at Corvei in which this line begins Eostar Eostar eordhan modor 

The name remain s mysterious 
The song breath es the pleas ure and worship of ancient till ers of the s oil in the labour s of the earth and in the good s the mother gave 
It has grown it seems out of the br east of earth herself earth is here the Mother of M en 
The sur face of earth is the lap of the Goddess in her womb let all grow th be plentiful 
Food is in her for the need s of men 
Hail be thou Earth 
I daresay this hymn was sung ten thousand years ago by the early Aryans on the Baltic coast 
Even in a twelfth century herbal we find a prayer to Earth and it is so beautiful that I close this chapter with it Earth divine goddess Mother Nature who generatest all things and bring est forth a new the sun which thou hast given to the nations Guardian of sky and sea and of all gods and powers and through thy power all nature fall s silent and then sinks in sleep 
And again thou bring est back the light and chase st away night and yet again thou cove rest us most se cure ly with thy shades 
Thou dost contain chaos in finite yea and wind s and show ers and storm s thou sendest them out when thou wilt and causest the sea s to roar thou chase st away the sun and arousest the storm 
Again when thou wilt thou sendest forth the joyous day and give st the nourish ment of life with thy eternal sure ty and when the soul depart s to thee we return 
Thou in deed art du ly called great Mother of the gods thou conque rest by thy divine name 
Thou art the source of the strength of nations and of gods without thee nothing can be brought to perfect ion or be born thou art great queen of the gods 
Goddess 
I adore thee as divine I call upon thy name be pleas ed to grant that which I ask thee so shall I give thanks to thee goddess with one faith 
Hear I beseech thee and be favour able to my prayer 
What soever herb thy power dost pro duc e give I pray with good will to all nations to sav e them and grant me this my medicine 
Come to me with thy powers and how soever I may use them may they have good success and to whom soever I may give them 
What ever thou dost grant it may pro s per 
To thee all things return 
Those who right ly receive these herbs from me do thou make them whole 
Goddess I beseech thee I pray thee as a supp liant that by thy majesty thou grant this to me 
Now I make in tercess ion to you all ye powers and herbs and to your majesty ye whom Earth pa rent of all hath produced and given as a medicine of health to all nations and hath put majesty upon you be I pray you the great est help to the human race

The stories of miraculous cures by famous Anglo Saxon bishops and abbots are for the most part too well known to be worth quoting but the un fair treatment of the leech is perhaps no where more cl early shown than in Bede s tale of St John of Beverley curing a boy with a disease d head

A small but striking instance of Saxon knowledge or rather close observat ion of plants is to be found in the following description of wolf s teazle in the Herbarium of Apuleius This wort hath leaves reversed and thorn y and it hath in its midst a round and thorn y knob and that is brown head ed in the blossom s and hath white seed and a white and very fragrant root 
The word reversed is not in the original and was therefore added by the Saxon translator who had observed the fact that all the thistle tri be pro tect their leaves by thorn s point ing back wards as well as for wards

A Pomeranian Rite An attempt was made a few days ago to cast a devil out of a woman liv ing in a village of the Lauenberg di strict of Pomerania on the Polish front ier 
She appear s to have been of a s our and somewhat hysterical temperament and three of the village gossips came to the conclusion that she was a victim of diabolical possession and resolved to effect a cure by mean s of enchant ment 
They first of all gathered the herbs need ed for the purpose in the forest at the proper con junction of the stars 
Then a tripod was formed of three chairs and to these the patient was bound 
Be neath her was fixed a pail of red hot coal on which the herbs were scattered 
As the fumes of the burn ing weeds veiled the victim the three neighbours crooned the prescribed exorcism 
The loud er the woman shrieked the loud er they sang and after the pro cess had been continued long enough to prove effect ive in their opinion they r an away believ ing that the devil would run out of the woman after them 
She however continued to shriek

Between the Anglo Saxon herbals and the early printed herbals there is a great gulf 
After the Nor man Conquest the old Anglo Saxon lore natural ly fell into dis repute although the Nor man s were inferior to the Saxons in their knowledge of herbs 
The learned books of the conque rors were written exclusive ly in Latin and it is s ad to think of the number of beautiful Saxon books which must have been destroy ed for when the Saxons were turned out of their own monasteries the Nor man s who s up plant ed them probably regarded books written in a language they did not understand as mere rub bish 
Much of the old Saxon herb lore is to be found in the leech books of the Middle Ages but with one not able exception no important original treatise on herbs by an English writer has come down to us from that period 
The vast majority of the herbal MSS 
are merely tran scription s of Macer s herbal a medieval Latin poem on the virtues of s even ty s even plants which is believed to have been written in the tenth century 
The popular ity of this poem is shown by the number of MSS 
still extant 
It was translated into English as early as the twelfth century with the addition of A fewe herbes wyche Macer tretyth not 
In it was translated by John Lelamoure a school master of Her tford 
On folio of the MS of this translation is the in scription God gracious of graunt is hav y the yyeue and ygrau ted vertuys in wood ys stonys and herbes of the whiche erb is Macer the philosofure made a boke in Latyne the whiche boke Johannes Lelamoure scolemaistre of Her for de est they he unworthy was in the yere of oure Lorde a m ccc 
lxxiij to urnyd in to Yngl is 
Macer s herbal is also the b as is of a treatise in rhyme of which there are several copies in England and one in the Royal Library at Stockholm 
This treatise which deal s with twenty four herbs begins thus quaint ly Of erb s xxiiij I woll you tell by and by Al s I fond wryten in a boke at I in boro yng toke Of a gret lady s p reste of gret name she bare st 
The poem begins with a description of betony power ful against wykked speryt is and then treats amongst other herbs of the virtues of centaury marigold celandine pimpernel mother wort vervain periwinkle rose lily hen bane agrimony sage rue fennel and violet 
It is pleasant to find the belief that only to look on marigold s will draw evil humour s out of the head and strength en the eyes ight 
Golde marigold is bitter in savour Fayr and yel w yellow is his flowur Ye golde flour is good to sene It makyth ye syth bryth and cl ene Wysce ly to lokyn on his flowr is Dr awyth owt of ye heed wikked hirores humour s 







Loke wysce ly on golde er ly at m or we morn ing Yat day fro feueres it sch all ye b or we Ye odour of ye golde is good to smelle 
The instruction s for the picking of this joyous flower are given at length 
It must be taken only when the moon is in the sign of the Virg in and not when Jupiter is in the ascendant for then the herb loses its virtue 
And the gather er who must be out of deadly s in must say three Pater Noster s and three Aves 
Amongst its many virtues we find that it gives the we are r a vi s ion of any one who has robbed him 
The virtues of vervain also are many it must be picked at Spr ing of day in ye monyth of May 
Periwinkle is given its beautiful old name joy of the ground men calle it ye Juy of Grownde and the description runs thus Parwynke is an er be grene of colour In tyme of May he b eryth blo flour His stalk ys a in are so feynt we ak and fe ye Yet never more growyth he he ye high

A manuscript of exception al interest is one describing the virtues of rosemary which was sent by the Countess of Hainault to her daughter Philippa Queen of England and a part from its intrinsic interest it is important from the fact that it is obviously the original of the very poe tical dis course on rosemary in the first printed English herbal commonly known as Banckes s herbal 
Moreover in this MS there is record ed an old tradition which I have not found in any other herbal but which is still cur rent amongst old fashion ed country folk name ly that rosemary pass eth not commonly in hight e the hight e of Criste w hill he was man on Er the and that when the plant attains the age of thirty three years it will increase in bread th but not in he ight 
It is the oldest MS in which we find many other beliefs about rosemary that still surviv e in England 
There is a tradition that Queen Philippa s mother sent the first plants of rosemary to England and in a copy of this MS in the library of Trinity College Cambridge the translator danyel ba in says that rosemary was unknown in England until the Countess of Hainault sent some to her daughter 
The only original treatise on herbs written by an English man during the Middle Ages was that by Bartholomeus Anglicus and on the plant l over there are probably few of the medieval writer s who exercise so potent a spell 
Even in the thirteen th century that age of great men Bartholomew the English man ranked with think ers such as Roger Bacon Thomas Aquinas and Albert us Magnus 
He was account ed one of the great est the ologians of his day and if his lecture s on the ology were as simple as his writings on herbs it is easy to understand why they were thronged and why his writings were so eager ly studied not only in his life time but for nearly three centuries afterwards 
A child could understand his book on herbs for being great he was simple 
But although his work De Proprietatibus Rerum which contain s nine teen books was the source of common information on Natural Hi story through out the Middle Ages and was one of the books hi red out at a regulate d price by the scholars of Paris we know very little of the writer 
He spent the greater part of his life in France and Saxon y but he was English born and was always known as Bartholomeus Anglicus 
We know that he studied in Paris and entered the French province of the Mino rite Order and later he became one of the most renowned pro fessors of the ology in Paris 
In a letter was receive d from the general of the Friars Mino r in the new province of Saxon y as king the pro vincial of France to send Bartholomew and another English man to help in the work of that province and the for mer subsequent ly went there 
We do not know the exact date of De Proprietatibus Rerum but it must have been written about the middle of the thirteen th century for though it cit es Albert us Magnus who was teach ing in Paris in there is no mention of any of the later authorities such as Thomas Aquinas Roger Bacon and Vincent de Beauva is 
It was certain ly known in England as early as for there is a copy of that date at Oxford and there still exist both in France and in England a consider able number of other manuscript copies most of which date from the latter part of the thirteen th century and the early part of the four teen th 
The book was translated into English in by John de Trevisa chaplain to Lord Berkeley and vicar of Berkeley and Bartholomew could scarcely have been more for tunate in his translator 
At the end of his translation Trevisa writes thus End less e grace blysse than kyng and pray s yng unto our Lorde God Omni potent be gyuen by who os ayde and helpe this tran s lac on was end yd at Berkeley e the syxte day e of Feuerer the yere of our Lorde MCCCLXXXXV III the yere of y e reyne of Kynge Rycharde the second e after the Conquest e of Englonde X XII

Salimbene show s that the book was known in Italy in and there are two MS copies in the Bibliotheque National e of Paris of which the earliest is date d 
Before Trevisa made his English translation it had been translated into French by Jehan Corbich on in for Charles V of France 
The book was first printed at Basle about and the esteem in which it was held may be judged from the fact that it went through at least four teen editions before and be sides the English and French translation s it was also translated into Spanish and Dutch 
The English translation was first printed by Caxton s famous apprentice Wynken de Worde 
The translator in a naive little in troductory poem says that just as he had look ed as a child to God to help him in his games so now he pray s Hi m to help him in this book

And in the preface Trevisa add resses his read ers thus Merveyle not ye wit ty and eloq uent red ers that I thy ne of wytte and voyde of cunning have tran slatid this boke from l at in to our vulgayre language as a thynge pro fit able to me and per adventure to many other why ch under stonde not latyn nor have not the knowledge of the pro prytees of thynge s 
The seventeenth book of De Proprietatibus Rerum is on herbs and their uses and it is full of allusions to the classical writer s on herbs Aristotle Dioscorides and Galen but the description s of the plants themselves are original and charm ing 
There is no record to show that Bartholomew the English man was a garden er but we can hard ly doubt that the man who described flowers with such loving care possess ed a garden and work ed in it 
The Herbarius zu Teutsch might have been written in a study but there is fresh air and the beauty of the liv ing flowers in Bartholomew s writings 
Of the lily he says The Le ly is an herbe wyth a whyte floure 
And though the levys of the floure be whyte yet wyth en shyneth the ly knesse of golde 
Bartholomew may have known nothing of the modern science of botany but he k new how to describe not only the lily but also the atmosphere of the lily in a word picture of inimitable simplicity and beauty 
One feels instinctive ly that only a child or a great man could have written those lines 
And is there not something unforgettable in these few words on the unf old ing of a rose And whan e they the petals ben full grow en they sprede the ymselues ayenst the sonne ry synge 
The chapter on the rose is long er than most and is so deli ghtful that I quote a consider able part of it 
The rose of gardens is plant ed and sette and tylth ed as a vyne 
And if it is for g end red and not sh red and pa red and not clensed of super fluyte the ne it go oth out of kynde and chaung eth in to a wylde rose 
And by oft chaung ing and tylth ing the wylde rose to rn eth and chaugith into a very rose

Illustration WOODCUT OF TREES AND HERBS FROM THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK OF DE PROPRIETATIBUS RERUM Printed by Wynkyn de Worde There follows a description too long to quote here of the grow th of the rose hip which ends with the remark But they ben not ful good to ete for rough nesse that is hyd wyth in

Also floures of spr yng ynge tyme spryngeth fyrste and sheweth somer 
The ly tylnes thereof in substaunce is no b ly rewarded in gret nesse of sauour and of vertue 
Bartholomew s description s of flowers are usual ly brief and there is a clarity and vivid ness about them which give them a charm peculiar ly their own 
How fresh and English for instance is his chapter on the apple 
I have never before seen the taste of an apple described as mer ry but how true the description is 
Malus the Ap pyll tree is a tree yt ber eth apple s and is a grete tree in itself it is more short than other trees of the wood wyth knottes and rinelyd Rynde 
And makyth shadowe wyth e thy cke bowes and braunches and fayr with dyuers blossom es and floures of swet nesse and lykynge with good e fruyte and noble 
And is gracious in sy ght and in taste and vertuous in medecyne some b eryth s our y sh fruyte and harde and some ryght s oure and some ryght swete with a good savour e and mery

And ben netheles moost of vertue 
Bartholomew gives the old mandrake legend in full though he add s it is so feynd of churles others of wytches and he also writes of its use as an anesthetic 
Further he record s two other beliefs about the mandrake which I have never found in any other English herbal name ly that while uprooting it one must beware of contrary wind s and that one must go on digging for it until sun set 
They that dygge man drag or a be be sy to beware of contrary wyndes why le they dig ge 
And make n circle s abowte with a swerder and abyde with the dygg ynge unto the sonne go ynge down e 
But a part from herbs and their uses the book De herb is is full of fleet ing yet vigorous picture s of the home ly everyday side of medieval life 
Bartholomew being one of the great est men of his century writes of matter s in which the simple st of us are interest ed 
He tells us of the feed ing of swine with acorns 
Of the making and ba king of bread including the thrifty custom of mix ing cooked be an s with the flour to make the b red e the more hevy 
Incidentally and with all due respect it may be remark ed that he had no prac tical knowledge of this subject his vivid description being obviously that of an interest ed spectator 
There is an air y mascu line vague ness about the conclusion of the whole matter of bread making and at last after many travailes man s lyfe is fedde and sustained there with 
He tells us of the use of laurel leaves to heal be e and was p stings and to keep books and cloth es from moths and other worm s of the making of fayr e im ages and of boxes where in to keep spycery from the wood of the box tree 
Of the making of trestle tables are a red and set upon feet of play ing boards that men play e on at the dyes d ice and other gamys 
And this maner of t able is double and arrayd wyth dyerse colour s 
Of the making of writing tables of wood used for floo ring that set in solar floo rs seru e all men and best ys y t ben there in and ben treden of all e men and bees ty s that come there in and so strong that they ben de not nor croke crack whan they ben pre ssyd w t heuy thynge s lay d on them

Of the making of to w un even and full of knob s used for stuff ing into the crack s in ship s and for bonds and by ndynges and matches for can delles for it is full drye and takyth s one fyre and brenn eth 
And so he con cludes somewhat breathlessly none herbe is so nedefull to so many dyurrse uses to man kynde as is the flexe 
Of the vineyard closyd about wyth walles and wyth hegges with a way te watch set in an hyghe place to kepe the vynyerde that the fruyte be not dystroyed 
Of the desol ation of the vineyard in winter but in harueste tyme many comyth and haunt eth the vynyerde 
Of the delicious smell of a vineyard 
Of the dam age done by foxes and swine and tame hounds 
A few hounds Bartholomew tells us was ten and dystroye moo grapes that cometh and et eth ther of the uyl ly thievish ly 
A vineyard he con cludes may e not be kepte nother sauyd but by his so c our and helpe that all thynge hath and possess eth in his power and myghte 
And kepyth and sauyth all lord ly and myghti ly 
And is there any other writer who in so few words tells us of the woods in those days 
Of the be est is and foul is there in as well as the herbs of the woods in summer time of the hunting there in of the robbers and the difficult y of find ing one s way 
Of the birds and the bees and the wild honey and the delicious cool ness of the deep s had e in summer and the we ry wayfarynge trauelynge men 
And the final brief suggestion of the time when forests were ver it able bound ari es 
I believ e also that this is the only book in which we are told of the interesting old custom of ty ing knots to the trees in token and mark e of ye high e waye and of robbers deli be rate ly remov ing them 
The picture is so perfect that I give it in full Woods ben wide places was t and desolate y t many trees grow e in w t out e fruyte and also few hauyinge fruyte

At the end of the book is the poem which has caused so much con troversy amongst bibliographers 
In this Wynken de Worde definite ly state s that Caxton had a sh are in the first printing of this book at Cologne And also of your charyte call to remembraunce The soul e of William Caxton first pryter of this boke 
In late n to nge at Col eyn hys elf to auauce That every well disposed man may there in loke 
In spite of this modern bibliographers are of opinion that Caxton could not have played even a sub ordinate part in the printing of this book at Cologne 
De Worde also refers to the make r of the paper John Tate the yonger 
Which late ha the in England doo make this paper thy nne That now in our Englysh this boke is pryn ted In ne 
There is charm as well as pathos in the verses on the reproduct ion of manuscripts in book form show ing us vivid ly what the recent discover y of the art of printing meant to the scholars of that day

The treatise on herbs formed as we have seen only a part of Bartholomew s De Proprietatibus Rerum and to speak strict ly the first printed English herbal was the small quarto volume published by Richard Banckes in 
It was the beginning of a series of small books chief ly in black letter 
All of them though issued from different p resses have nearly the same title and they va ry only s light ly from the original Banckes s Herbal 
The title of this Herbal is Here begynn eth a new mater the whiche sheweth and treat eth of ye vertues pro prytes of her be s the whiche is called an Herball

We do not know who the author of this book was and it has been sugges ted that it is based on some medieval English manuscript now lost 
Certa in ly when one read s this anonymous work known as Banckes s Herbal one is struck not only by its super iority to the later and more famous Grete Herball but also by its greater charm 
It gives the impression of being a compil ation from various sources the author hav ing made his own se lect ion from what pleas ed him most in the older English manuscript herbals 
It seems to have been a labour of love where as the Grete Herball is merely a translation 
It is almost certain that the writer made use of one of the numerous manuscript versions of Macer s Herbal which in parts Banckes s Herbal resembles very closely and the chapter on rosemary show s that he had access to one of the copies of the manuscript on the virtues of rosemary which was sent by the Countess of Hainault to Queen Philippa 
He does not give the beautiful old tradition preserve d in that manuscript but he ascribes wonderful virtues to this herb with the same loving enthusiasm and almost in the same words 
Of rosemary in Banckes s Herbal we read Take the flowers thereof and make powder thereof and binde it to thy right arme in a linnen cloath and it shal e make thee light and mer rie 
Take the flowers and put them in thy che st among thy cloth es or among thy Book es and Mothes shall not destroy them 
Boyle the leaves in white wine and was he thy face there with and thy br owes and thou shalt have a fair e face 
Also put the leaves under thy bedde and thou shalt be delivered of all evil l dreames 
Take the leaves and put them into wine and it shall keep the wine from all s our ness and evil l savour s and if thou wilt sell thy wine thou shalt have good e speede 
Also if thou be feeb le boyle the leaves in clean e water and was he thyself and thou shalt wax shiny 
Also if thou have lost appetite of eat ing boyle well these leaves in clean e water and when the water is colde put there unto as much of white wine and then make sops eat them thereof wel and thou shalt restore thy appetite again e 
If thy legges be blow en with gowte boyle the leaves in water and binde them in a linnen cloath and wind e it about thy legges and it shall do thee much good 
If thou have a cough drink the water of the leaves boy ld in white wine and ye shall be whole 
Illustration INITIAL LETTERS FROM BANCKES S HERBAL Take the Timber thereof and burn it to coal es and make powder thereof and rub be thy teeth thereof and it shall keep thy teeth from all evil s 
Smell it oft and it shall keep thee young ly 
Also if a man have lost his smell yng of the ayre that he may not draw his breath make a fire of the wood and ba ke his bread there with eat e it and it shall keep e him well 
Make thee a box of the wood of rosemary and smell to it and it shall preserve thy youth 
That Banckes s Herbal achieved immediate popular ity is at tes ted by the fact that the following year another edition of it was issued and during the next thirty years various London printer s issued the same book under different title s 
Robert Wyer ascribed the author ship of those he issued to Macer and in the edition of he added after Macer s Herbal Practysed by Dr 
Lynacro 
Whet her this statement is true it is impossible to discover but we know that the great doctor died some years before Wyer set up as a printer and his name does not appear in any of the subsequent editions of the herbal issued by other printer s 
In Wyer s edition there are some good initial letters very similar to those used by Wynkyn de Worde 
The most interesting edition of the herbal is that printed by William Copland in which first appear the addition al chapter s on The virtues of water s stylled The tyme of gather ing of sede s and A general rule of all maner of herbes 
He issued two editions bear ing the same title and diffe ring only in the woodcut s and the col ophon 
The title is A boke of the pro pret ies of Herbes called an her b all where unto is added the tyme y e herbes floures and Sedes s hold be gathered to be kept the whole ye re with the vertue of ye Herbes whe they are stylled 
Al so a gener all rule of all ma ner of Herbes draw en out of an auncyent booke of Phisyck by W C The woodcut in the first edition is three Tudor roses in a double circle with a cr own over one of the roses and a cross the rib and Kyge of floures 
In the second edition the woodcut is a quaint little re present ation of a lady sea ted in a garden 
One man stand ing behind her is holding her and another is wal king to wards her 
The three figures are near a w all on the other side of which several men are apparently con ver sing 
Who W C was is un certain 
In the Dictionary of National Biography William Copland is said to be both the author and the printer of the book but in many catalogue s notably in that of the British Museum Walter Cary figures as the author 
In a length y account of the Cary s in Not es and Queries March Mr A L Humphreys disposes con clusive ly of the s up position that W C can stand for Walter Cary 
A Boke of the Properties of Herbes bear s on the title page the initial s W C which may stand either for Copland or Cary 
This was one of several editions of Banckes s Herbal then very popular and although it may have been edi ted or pro mo ted in some way by a Walter Cary it could not have been by the one who wrote The Ham mer for the St one 
The Herball was issued some where about and various editions of it exist but all these appear ed when the Walter Cary we are consider ing was a child 
There is however a connection between the Cary s and herbals because it is well known that Henry Lyte of Lyte s Cary was the famous translator of Dodoen s s Herball and he had a herbal garden at Lyte s Cary 
Ames in his Typographical Antiquities describe s the two editions which are ide n tical as though they were two different books and ascribes one to Walter Cary and the other to William Copland 
We have only Ames s authority for the s up position that Copland was the compil er as well as the printer 
The herbal in question is merely another edition of Banckes s Herbal but it is quite possible that the three addition al chapter s at the end were draw en out of an auncyent booke of Phy sick by Copland 
T wo editions of Banckes s Herbal are ascribed on account of the word ing of the title to Antony Askham and the title is so attractive that it is a disap point ment to find that the astrological addition s declar yng what herbes hath influence of certain sterres and constellations etc do not appear in any known copy of the herbal 
This astrological lore from the famous man who combined the pro fessions of priest physician and astrologer in the reign of Edward VI 
would be of remarkable interest 
But it has been pointed out by Mr H M Barlow that if the bibliographers who have attributed the work to Askham had examined the title of the work with greater care they would have observed that the phrase by Anthonye Askham refers not to the substance of the book itself which is merely another edition of Banckes s Herbal but to the Almanacke from which the addition s were in t ended to be taken though apparently they were never printed 
The title of Askham s Herbal is A lytel herb all of the properties of her be s newe ly amend ed and correct ed with certayne add ic ion s at the ende of the boke declar ying what herbes hath influence of certain e Sterres and constellations where by may be chosen the beast and most luck ye tyme s and dayes of their mini stra ci on accord ying e to the Moone being in the sig ne s of heauen the which is day ly appoyn ted in the Almanacke made and gathered in the yere of our Lorde god M D L

There are some charm ing prescriptions to be found in Askham s Herbal 
Under rose for instance we have recipes for melroset sugar rose t syrope of Rooses oyle of roses and rose water 
Melro sette is made thus 
Take fair e purified hony e and new read rooses the whyte ende s of them clypped a waye tha chop they m smal and put the into the Hony and boy l the men e ly together to know whan it is boyle d ynoughe ye shal know it by the swete odour and the colour read 
Fyve yeares he may be kept in his vertue by the Roses he hath vertue of comforting e and by the hony he hath vertu of clens ing e 
Syrope of Rooses is made thus 
Some do take roses dy ght as it is sayd and boyle them in water and in the water stra yned thei put suger and make a sirope thereof and some do make it better for they put roses in a vessel l hau ing a stra y ght mou the and they put to the roses hote water and thei let it stande a day and a night and of that water put ting to it suger thei do make sirope and some do e put more of Roses in the for said vessel and more of hote water and let it stande as is before said e and so they make a read water and make the rose syrope 
And some do stape new Roses and then st rayne out the joy ce of it and suger ther wyth they make sirope and this is the best making of sirope 
In Wynter and in Some r it may e be geuen com petent ly to feble sick e melaco ly and colorike people 
Sugar Rose t is made thus Take newe gathered roses and stape them right e smal with sugar tha put in a glasse XXX 
dayes let it stande in ye sunne and stirre it wel and medle it well together so it may be kept three yeares in his vertue 
The qu atitie of sugar and roses should be thus 
In I III 
pound of sugar a pound e of roses 
Oyle of roses is made thus 
Some boyle roses in oyle and kepe it some do fyll a glasse with roses and oyle and they boyle it in a caudr on full of water and this oyle is good 
Some stampe fresh roses with oyle and they put it in a vessel of glasse and set it in the sune I III 
d a is and this oyle is good 
Rose water 
Some do put rose water in a glass and they put roses with their de w ther to and they make it to boil e in water tha thei set it in the sune tyll it be read de and this water is best e 
Under the same flower we find this fragrant example of the widespread medieval belief in the efficacy of good smell s Also drye roses put to ye nose to smell do coforte the braine and the harte and quencheth sp rite 
The herbalists were never we a ry of teach ing the value of sweet scent s 
If odour s may work e satisf acti on wrote Gerard in his Herball they are so soveraigne in plants and so comfortable that no confection of the apothecaries can equal l their excellent vertue 
One of the most delicious scent prescriptions in Askham is to be found under Violet For the that may not slepe for sickness see th this herb in water and at euen let him so ke well hys feet e in the water to the ancles wha he go eth to bed bind of this herbe to his temp les and he shall slepe wel by the grace of God 
The most curious recipe is that under wood binde 
Go to the root e of wood binde and make a hole in the mi ddes of the root e than c over it well again e y t no ayre go out nor that no rayne go in no water nor earth nor the sune come not to much to it let it stande so a night and a day tha after that go to it and thou shalt fynde there in a certayne lycoure 
Take out that lycoure with a sp one and put it into a clean gla s and do so every day as long as thou fynde st ought in the hole and this must be done in the m on eth of Ap ril or May e than anoynt the sore ther with against the fyre tha we te a ly nnen cloth e in the same lycoure and la ppe it about the sore and it shal be hole in short e space on war rantyse by the Grace of God 
Un like the later Grete Herball Askham gives some description s of the herbs themselves notably in the case of alleluia wood sorrel water crowfoot and as ter ion 
This herbe alleluia me call it Wods our or Stub wort this herbe hath thre leaves ye which be roud a litel depart ed aboue and it hath a whyte flour but it hath no loge stalk es and it is Woods oure and it is like thre leue d grasse 
The vertue of this herbe is thus if it be ros ted in the ashes in red dock e leaves or in red wort leaves it frett eth awai dead flesh of a wound e 
This herbe groweth much in wood es 
Water crowfoot This herb that men call water crowfoot hath ye low floures as hath crowfoot and of the same shap but the leves are more depart ed as it were Rammes fete and it hath a long stalk e and out of that one stalk e groweth many stalk es smal by ye sides 
This herb groweth in water y places 
As ter ion or Lunary groweth among stoones and in high places this herb shyneth by night and he bring eth forth purple floures hole and round e as a knockebell or else lyke to foxgloves the leves of this herbe be round e and blew and they have the mark of the Moone in the my ddes as it were thre leved grasse but the leaves ther of be more and they be round as a peny 
And the stalk of this herb is red and thy se herb semeth as it were musk and the joy ce ther of is ye low and this groweth in the new Moone without leve and euery day spryngeth a newe leaue to the ende of fyftene dayes and after fyftene dayes it loos eth euery day a leaue as the Moone wane th and it springeth and wane th as do th the Moone and where that it groweth there groweth great qu antitie 
The vertue of this herbe is thus thei that eat of the ber is or of the herbe in w an ing of the moon e wha he is in sig no virg in is if he have the fall ing euell he shal be hole thereof or if he be are thy s about his neck he shal be holpen without d out e 
And it hath many more vertues than I can tell at this tyme 
One of the un identified herbs is called sene and we are given the somewhat vague geographical information It groweth in the other sy de the sea and most e about e Babil on 
An other small book printed by William Copland must be mentioned for although it is not a herbal it contain s a great deal of curious herb lore not to be found else where 
This is The boke of secretes of Albartus Magnus of the vertues of Herbes St one s and certain e beast es 
Who the author was is unknown but he was certain ly not Albert of Bollstadt Bishop of Ratisb on the scholastic philosop her to whom it was ascribed probably in order to increase its s ale 
There is one philosop hical remark which is not unworthy of the famous Bishop E very man de sp is eth ye thyng where of he know eth no thynge and that hath done no pleas ure to him 
But for the most part it deal s with the popular beliefs concerning the mystic al properties of herbs stones and animals 
Of celandine the writer tells us This hear be springeth in the time in ye which the swallowes and also ye Eagles make th theyr nestes 
If any man shal have this herbe with ye harte of a Molle mo le he shall over come all his enemies And if the before named hear be be put upon the head de of a sy cke man if he should d ye he shal s yng an one with a loud voyce if not he shall we ep 
Perwynke when it is be at e unto pouder with worm es of ye earth wrap ped about e it and with an herbe called houslyke it in duc eth love between man and wyfe if it be e used in their meales if the s ayde confection be put in the fyre it shall be turned an one unto blue colour e 
Of the herb which he tells us the men of Chaldea called roybra he says He that hold eth this herbe in hys had e with an herbe called Mylf oyle or yaro we or noseblede is sure from all fear e and fantasye or vys ion 
And yf it be put with the juyce of house lyke and the bear ers hands be anoynt ed with it and the residue be put in water if he ent re in ye water where fyshes be they wil gather together to hys hand es and if hys hand e be draw e forth they will leap e agayne to they re owne places where they were before 
Of hound s to ngue If ye shall have the afore named herbe under thy for most to e al the dog ge s shall kepe silence and shall not have power to bark 
And if thou shalt put the aforesayde thinge in the neck e of any dog ge so y t he may e not touch e it with his mou the he shal be turned always round about lyke a turn ing w hele until l he fall unto the ground e as dead and this hath ben e prove d in our tyme 
Of centaury If it be joy n ed with the blo ude of a female lap w ing or black pl over and be put with oyle in a lampe all they that com pass e it about e shal be leue themselves to be witches so that one shall be leve of an other that his head is in heaven and his fete in the earth 
And if the afore said thynge be put in the fire whan the starres shine it shall appear e y t the sterres run ne one agaynste another and fy ght 
Of vervain This herbe as witches say gathered the sunne be yng in the sign e of the Ram and put with g rayne or corn e of pyonie of one ye are old e heal eth them y t be sick e of ye fall ing sykenes

Thou gh lac king in the charm of the quaint and typical ly English Banckes s Herbal the most famous of the early printed herbals was the Grete Herball printed by Peter Treveris in 
The grete herb all whiche geueth parfyt knowlege and under stand yng of all maner of herbes there gracyous vertues whiche god hath ordeyned for our prosperous wel fare and helth for they hele cure all maner of dyseases and sekenesses that fall or mysfortune to all maner of creatoures of god created prac ty s ed by many expert and wyse maysters as Auicenna and other c Also it geueth full parfyt e understand ynge of the booke late ly pryn ted by me Peter tr ever is named the noble experiens of the vertuous hand warke of surgery

According to the in troduct ion it was compiled from the works of many noble doctoures and expert e maysters in medecines as Auicenna Pandecta Constantinus Wilhelmus Platearius Rabbi Moyses Johannes Mesue H a ly Albert us Bartholomeus and more other 
But with the exception of the preface the Grete Herball is a translation of the well known French herbal Le Grant Herbier 
Until about Le Grant Herbier was supposed to be a translation of the Herbarius zu Teutsch published at Mainz in or of the Ortus Sanitatis printed also at Mainz in 
The Herbarius zu Teutsch which was probably compiled by a Frankfort physician is a fine herbal beautiful ly illustrated and the later Ortus Sanitatis is by some authorities supposed to be a Latin translation of it 
To judge from the preface to the German Herbarius it was a labour of love under taken by a man who apparently was possess ed of ample we al th and lei sure for in his preface he tells us that he caused this praiseworthy work to be begun by a Master learned in physic and then find ing that as many of the herbs did not grow in his native land he could not draw them with their true colour s and form he left the work un finished and journey ed through many land s Italy Croatia Albania Dalmatia Greece Corfu Candia Rhodes Cyprus the Ho ly L and Arabia Babylonia and Egypt 
He was accompanied by a painter ready of wit and cunning and sub tle of hand and was thus able to have the herbs tru ly draw n 
The book he compiled on his return was long regarded as the original of the French herbal Le Grant Herbier but in Professor Giulio Camus found two fifteen th century manuscripts in the Biblioteca Estense at Modena one the Latin work commonly known from the open ing words as Circa Instans and the other a French translation of the same manuscript 
It was always supposed by medical his to rians that the Circa Instans was written by Matthaeus Platearius of Salerno in the twelfth century but in Professor Camus s memoir L Opera Saleritana Circa Instans ed il tes to primitivo del Gr and Herbier in Francoys secu n do duo codici del secolo X V con servati nella Regia Biblioteca Estense there are re produced the French verses in which occurs the line I l a est e escript Millccc cinquante et hu it and Mr H M Barlow supp or ts the deduct ion that Circa Instans was not written by a Salernitan physician but by a writer described in the verses as Bartholomaeus mini d s en is in 
Le Grant Herbier of which the English Grete Herball is a translation is a ver s ion of the French manuscript translation of Circa Instans and therefore as Circa Instans is older than either the Herbarius zu Teutsch or the Latin Ortus Sanitatis it would seem that it is the real original of our Grete Herball 
The preface to the Grete Herball however bear s a strong resemblance to that of the German Herbarius of which I quote a part from Dr Arber s translation made from the second Augsburg edition of 
They have been place d in parallel columns to show how closely the English preface follows that of the German Herbarius 
Pre face to the Herbarius zu Teutsch 
Many a time and oft have I con temp late d in ward ly the wondrous works of the creator of the uni verse how in the beginning He formed the heaven s and adorned them with good ly shining stars to which he gave power and might to influence everything under heaven 
Also how he afterwards formed the four elements fire hot and dry air hot and moist water cold and moist earth dry and cold and gave to each a nature of its own and how after this the same Great Master of Nature made and formed herbs of many sort s and animals of all kind s and last of all M an the noble st of all created things 
There upon I thou ght on the wondrous order which the Creator gave these same creatures of His so that everything which has its being under heaven receive s it from the stars and keep s it by their help 
I consider ed further how that in everything which arise s grow s live s or s oars in the four elements named be it metal stone herb or anim al the four nature s of the elements he at cold moist ness and dry ness are mingle d 
It is also to be not ed that the four nature s in question are also mixed and bl ended in the human body in a measu re and temperament su it able to the life and nature of man while man keep s with in this measu re he is strong and heal thy but as soon as he steps or fall s beyond which happens when he at take s the up per hand and strives to stifle cold or on the contrary when cold begins to supp ress he at he fall s of necessity into sickness and draw s nigh unto death 
Of a truth I would as soon count the leaves on the trees or the grain s of s and in the sea as the things which are the cause s of man s sickness 
It is for this reason that so many thousand s and thousand s of perils and dangers be set man 
He is not ful ly sure of his health or his life for one mo ment 
While consider ing these matter s I also remembe red how the Creator of Nature who has place d us am id such dangers has mer ci ful ly pro vided us with a remedy that is with all kind s of herbs animals and other created things By virtue of these herbs and created things the sick man may recover the temperament of the four elements and the health of his body 
Since then man can have no greater nor noble r treasure on earth than bodi ly health I came to the conclusion that I could not per form any more use ful and holy work than to compil e a book in which could be contain ed the virtue and nature of many herbs and other created things together with their true colour s and for the help of all the world and the common good therefore I caused this praiseworthy work to be begun by a Master learned in physic who at my request gathered into a book the nature and virtue of many herbs out of the acknowledged master s of physic Galen Avicenna Serapio Dioscorides Pandecta ri us Platearius and others

The illustration s in the Grete Herball are poor being merely inferior copies of those in the later editions of the Herbarius zu Teutsch 
In the majority of cases it is impossible to identify the plant from the figure and the same figure is some times pre fixed to different plants 
But if the illustration s are poor and dul l the frontispiece and the full page woodcut of the printer s mark are very much the re verse 
The frontispiece is a charm ing woodcut of a man holding a spade in his right hand and gather ing grapes and a woman throw ing flowers and herbs out of her apr on into a basket 
There are two figures in the low er corn ers the one of a male and the other of a female mandrake 
The woodcut of the printer s mark at the end shed s an interesting ray of light on the Peter Treveris who issued the two first editions of this Herball 
The woodcut represen ts two wodows sav ages a man and a woman on either side of a tree from which is suspended a shield with Peter Treveris s initial s 
Ames supp os es that Treveris was a native of Treves and took his name from that city but it is more like ly that he was a member of the Cornish family of Treffry which is some times spelt Treveris 
A Sir John Treffry who fought at Poitiers took as supp orters to his arms a wild man and woman and one like s to find that one of his descendant s per petua ted the memory of his gallant ancestor by adop ting the same sign for his trade device 
The Grete Herball is alpha be tical ly arranged for the idea of the natural relation ship of plants was unknown at that time 
But we find a class if ic ation of fungi 
Fungi ben musherons

As in most sixteenth and seventeenth century herbals there are quaint description s of a good many things be sides herbs 
The most g rue some of these is a substance brief ly described as mummy and the accompanying illustration is of a man digging be side a tomb 
Mummy one read s is a maner of spyces or con fectyons that is found e in the sepulchres or tomb es of dead body es that haue be confyct with spyces 
And it is to wyte that in old e tyme men were wont to confyct the deed corpses and anoynt e them with bawme and my re smell ynge swete 
And yet ye paynims about babyl on kepe that custom e for there is grete qu an t ity of bawme 
And this mummy e is special ly found e about the brayne and about the maronge in the rydge bone 
For the blode by reason of the bawme draweth to the brayne and there about is chauffed 
And lyke wise is the brayne b rent and parched and is the qu antyte of mommye and so the blode is mroeued in the rydge of the back e 
That mommye is to be chosen that is bryght black e stynkynge and styffe

The dissertation on water show s very cl early that our ancestors regarded bath ing as a fad and a dangerous fad at that 
The writer gloom i ly observe s many folk e that hath bath ed them in colde water haue dyed or they came home 
And those who are foolish enough to drink water he war n s by quoting the authority of May s ter Isaac who sayth that it is impossible for them that drynk eth over much e water in theyr youth to come to ye age that God hath ordeyned them 
In the description of the lodestone we find the well known popular belief about ship s being draw n to their destruct ion 
The lodestone the adamant stone that draweth yren hath myghte to draw yren as Aristotle sayth 
And is found e in the brymmes of the occyan see 
And there be hill is of it and these hyll is draw e ye ship pe s that haue nayles of yren to them and breke the shyppes by draw ynge of the nayles out 
The accompanying illustration is of a s in king ship with a man go ing to wards the hill of adamant with up lif ted hands while another man is swimm ing and a third s its calmly in the ship 
In view of the free use of honey in old en times the account of honey in the Grete Herball seems in adequate 
Hony is made by artyfyce and craft of bees 
The whyche bees draweth the thy n nest parte of the floures and parte ly e of the thick est and moost grosse and thereof make th hony and wax e and also they make a substaunce that is called the hony com be 
The tame hony is that that is made in the hous or hyues that labour ers ordeyn eth for the sayd bees to lodge and work e in 
Hony is whyte in cold places and brown e in warm place 
And hony ought to be put in medicyn e and may be kept C yeeres 
There is an other that is called wylde hony and is found in wood es and is not so good as the other and is more bytter 
Also there is a honey called cast anea because it is made of chestayne floures that the bees suck eth and is bytter 
In the Grete Herball as in Banckes s Herball we find numerous instance s of the use of herbs as amulets or for their effect on the mind and for the s mo king of patient s with their fumes 
I quote the following Betony 
For them that be fer full

Oyle of vyolettes is made thus

It is in this herbal that we find the first avowal of dis belief in the supposed powers of the mandrake 
There be two maner s the male and the female the female hath sharp e leves 
Some say that it is better for medycyn e than the male but we use of both e 
Some say that the male hath figure of shap e of a man

For Nature never gaue for me or shap e of ma kynde to an herbe

The only important books Treveris published be sides the Grete Herball were the two English translation s of Hieronymus Braunschweig s works The noble expery ence of the virtuous Handy work e of Surgeri and The vertuous e Book of the Dystillacion of the Water s of all maner of Herbes and the hand some edition of Trevisa s translation of Higden s Polychroni con 
The vertuous e Book of the Dystillacion of the Water s of all maner of Herbes is well printed but the illustration s are from the same inferior German cuts as those in the Grete Herball

Turner s Herbal 
Like so many sixteenth century not abilities William Turner commonly known as the father of English botany was remarkably ver s a tile for he was a divine a physician and a botanist 
He was a native of Morp eth Nor thumberl and and was born in Henry VI II 
s reign the exact date is unknown 
His father is supposed to have been a tanner 
We know nothing of his early e duc ation but he entered what is now Pembroke College Cambridge under the patron age of Thomas Lord Wentworth 
This he himself tells us in the preface to the second part of his herbal which is dedicated to Lord Wentworth of the next gener ation 
And who hath de serve d better to have my booke of herbs to be given to him than he whose father with his y early ex hibition did helpe me be ying student in Cambridge of Phy sik and philosop hy 
Where by with some further help and study am com med to this pore knowledge of herbes and other simple s that I have 
Where for e I dedicate unto you this my litle boke de sy ring you to defen de it against the envious evil speak ers which can a low nothing but that they do themselves and the same I give unto your Lord ship beseech ing to take it in the stede of a better thyng and for a token of my good will to ward you and all your father s hous hold which th ing if ye do as sonne as I shall have convenient le sure ye shall have the third and last parte of my herb all also 
Al mighty God kepe you and all your es 
Amen 
At Cambridge Turner was intimate with Nicholas Ridley afterwards the famous Bishop of London and though it is interesting to know that Ridley instructed him in Greek it is even more attractive to learn that the future bishop also initiated him into the mysteries of ten n is and archery 
Turner did well at the university for he was elec ted Ju nior Fellow of his college in and Joint Treasurer in and he had a title for Order s in 
Throughout his life he was a staunch Protestant and at Cambridge he used to at t end the preach ing s of Hugh Lati mer 
We do not know how long Turner held his fell ow ship possibly till his marri age with Jan e daughter of George And er Al der man of Cambridge 
He left Cambridge in and travelled about preach ing in various places 
In Wood s A the ne Oxonienses we read In his rambles he settled for a time in Oxon among several of his country men that he found there purpose ly for the con ver s ation of men and books At the same time and after following his old trade of preach ing without a call he was imprisoned for a consider able time 
On his release he left England and travelled in Italy German y and Holl and 
He tells us in his herbal that he visit ed Cremona Como Milan Venice and Chiavenna and at Bologna he studied botany under Luca Ghini 
Ei ther there or at Ferrara he took his M D 
degree 
From Italy he went to Zu rich where he formed his intimate and life long friend ship with Conrad Gesner the famous Swiss natural is t 
He subsequent ly visit ed Basle and Cologne and it was in these two cit ies that his small religious books up holding the Protestant cause were printed 
They were very popular in England so much so that in the last year of Henry VI II 
s reign they were pro hibi ted 
Turner spent some time botani sing in the Rhine country in his herbal he speak s of different plants which he collect ed at Bonn Basel Bingen Cologne Erenf felde and Sieburg 
Then he went to Holl and and East Friesl and the latter he frequently mention s and became physician to the Er le of Emden 
It was probably at this time that he explo red the islands off the mainland 
He was in correspondence with Maister Ri che and maister Morgan Ap otecaries of London two names which it is interesting to not e occur also in de l Obel s works and in Gerard s Herbal 
Turner wrote the first part of his Herbal when he was abroad but he delayed public ation until the conclusion of his wander ing s 
On his return to England he became chaplain and physician to the Duke of Somerset and it is general ly believed that he s at in the Ho use of Commons 
He was promised the pre ben d of Botevant in York and in a letter written to than k Cecil for the pro mi se we find the remark My chylde r have ben e f ed so long with hope that they are very leane i w old fayne have the fatter if it were possible 
Turner held this a p point ment for little more than two years and after failing to obtain either the pro vost ship of Oriel College Oxford or the pre side n cy of Magdalen he seems to have be come despondent 
He want ed a house where i may studie in and have su place to lay my bookes in and in another letter he com plains of being pened up in a ch amber with all my ho use hold e seru an tes and children as she pe in a pyndfolde i can not go to my booke for ye cry ing of child er and noyse yt is made in my ch amber 
Final ly he beg ged leave to go abroad where I will also fini she my great herb all and my bookes of fishes stones and metal les if God send me lyfe and helthe 
He was subsequent ly made De an of Wells but he lost this off ice on the access ion of Mary and like so many of the Protestant divine s he went abroad 
He stayed at Bonn Frankfort Freiburg Lauterburg 
Lauenburg Mainz Rodekir che Strasburg Speyer Worm s Cologne and Weissenburg 
At Cologne and Weissenburg he had gardens and it was from Cologne that he published the second part of his Herbal 
His works were pro claim ed here tical for the second time in and the Wardens of every Comp any had to give not ice of any copy they had in order that they might be destroy ed 
It is not surprising that Turner s works are r are 
On the access ion of Elizabeth he return ed to England and was reinsta ted in the deanery of Wells 
His diocesan seems to have found him troub le some for in the Bishop of Bath and Wells wrote I am much en comb red with mr 
Doctor Turner De an e of We l les for his in discreete be hav i or in the pulp it where he medle th w th all matter s 
I have advertised him by wrytynges and have admoni shed secret ly by his owne frendes not with stand ing he persis t eth still in his fol lie he con ten eth all Bishop p s and call eth the white coats typpett gentleme with other word es of re pro che mu che more unsemlie and ask eth who gave them autoritie more ouer me then I ouer them 
GILBERT BATH AND WELLS 
January There is a story told that Turner trained his dog at a given sign to snatch the bishop s square cap off his head when the pre late was d in ing with him 
If this is true possibly it account s for the fact that he was subsequent ly suspended for No nconformity after which being pre cluded from clerical duties he left Wells and return ed to London 
He lived in Crutched Friars and like the two other Elizabeth an herbalists had a famous garden 
He was in failing health when he complete d his herbal and there is extant a pathetic letter the greater part of it written by an amanuens is to his staunch patron Lord Burleigh which is sign ed Y our old and seik ly client wllm turn er doctor of physic 
Turner died in and was bur ied in S Olave s Crutched Friars where the tablet to his memory can still be seen

In his will which is too long to quote here Turner be qu eathed to his wife his best pece or syluer vessel l and halfe dozen of syluer sp one s and to his nephew my ly t tell fur red g owne 
Peter the s on to whom he left all my write n bookes and if he be a preach er all my diuinitie bookes yf he prac tise Phisicke all my physic ke bookes had some knowledge of plants for in a copy of Turner s Herbal in the Linnean Society s Library there is a long list of er r at a for which Peter Turner apologised in an A d dres s to the R e a der 
There is something very naive and charm ing about Peter s ad mi r ation for his father s f a me and est im ation 
He tells us that he has d il ige n t ly compared the printed book with his father s owne hand e copie and re f r a in s from hav ing the whole book printed again because I should have done against C ha r it ie to have caused the P r in ter by that mean es to l os e all his l ab or and cost which he hath best owed in printing here of 
Where for e g ent le R e a der be are a little with the P r in ter that never was much ac custom ed to the printing of English e and afore thou read e over this booke correct it as I haue a p pointed and then the pro fit thereof will ab un d an t ly re com p en se thy pa yn es 
In the mean e time v se this Herbal e in stede of a better and give all laude and pray se unto the Lorde 
Turner was the first English man who studied plants scientific all y and his herbal mark s the beginning of the science of botany in England 
Like most writer s of any value he im pre s s ed his personal ity upon his books and these show him to have been a man of in do mit able character c au st ic wit and in de p end ent thou ght 
V i r so l id a e er u d it ion is judicii he is called by John R a y 
His first botani c al work was the L i be l l us de re herb ari a no v us printed by John By d del l in London 
This little book is particular ly interesting because it is the first in which l o c al it ies of native British plants are given 
In he published another small book entitled The names of herbes in Gr e ke Latin English e D u che and French e wyth the common e names that Herb ari es and Ap otecaries use gathered by William Turner 
In the preface he tells us that he had begun to set fur th an herbal in latyn but that when he ask ed the ad vi ce of physician s their ad vi se was that I should e cease from set t ynge out of this boke in l at in till I had sene those places of England e where in is most e pl ent ie of herbes that I might in my herbal declar e to the great e h on oure of our count re what nu m br e of s over eine and s tran g herbes were in England that were not in other nations whose cou n sell I have fol owed de fer ry ing to set out my herbal in latyn ty l that I have sene the we st count re y which I never saw e yet in al my lyfe which count re y of al places of England as I he are say is most e rich e ly rep le n is he d wyth al kind es of stra un ge and wonderful l work es and gift es of nature as are stones herbes fishes and metal les when as they that mou ed me to the set t yng fur th of my l at in herbal hear de this so reason able an ex c use they moved me to set out an herbal in English e as Fuchs i us dy d in l at in e wyth the di scription s figures and properties of as many herbes as I had sene and k newe to whom I could make no other an s were but that I had no such le a sure in this v o c ation and place that I am no we in as is ne c cess a ry for a man that should e take in hand e such e an in ter p r is e 
But thy s ex c use could e not be ad mit ted for both ce rt eine scholars poti c ari es and also surgeons requi red of me if that I would e not set fur th my l at in herbal before I have sene the we st parte s and have no le a sure in thy s place and v o c ation to write so great a work e at the least to set fur th my judge ment of the names of so many herbes as I k new whose request I have ac com pl is he d and have made a litle boke which is no more but a t able or reg est re of such e boke s as I in ten de by the grace of God to set fur th here after if that I may o b t eine by your grace s heal p such l i be rt ie and le a sure with convenient place as shall be necessary for such e a purpose 
Turner s not able work his Herbal is the only original work on botany written by any English man in the sixteenth century 
The first part of it was printed in London by St even M ier d man a Protestant re f u ge e from An t we r p in 
The second part was printed by Arn old Birck man at Cologne in during Turner s en for c ed ex il e 
Birck man also printed the edition of which contain ed all three parts 
For the full title etc see Bibliography of Herbals p 

One of the most attractive feature s of this Herbal is the number of beautiful woodcut s with which it is illustrated 
A few were special ly draw n and cut for the author but the great majority are reproduct ion s of the ex qu is it e drawings in Fuchs s herbals De his to ri a St i r p ium and N e ue Kreuterbuch 
N early all the illustration s in the famous sixteenth century F le mi sh English and Swiss herbals were printed from the actual wood blo cks or copied from the illustration s in Fuchs s works 
Not ab ly in Hieronymus B o c k s Kreuter B u ch Rembert Dodoen s s Cruydtboeck Henry Lyte s N ie we Herball and Jean B au h in s His to ri a plant arum uni ver s al is 
It is a remarkable fact that so far as wood en g r a v ing is con c ern ed this country has con tri but ed nothing to the art of plant illustration 
In the first English illustrated Herbal the Grete Herball of the figures are merely copies of the inferior cuts in the later editions of the Herbarius zu Teutsch and with the exception of Parkinson s Paradisus all the English sixteenth and early seventeenth century herbals b or r owed their illustration s from F le mi sh or German sources 
Fuchs had two set s of blo cks for his Herbal one for the folio edition of and the other for the octavo edition of 
It was the blo cks for the latter which were b or r owed by Turner s printer and it has been sugges ted that it was his desire to se cure these beautiful illustration s which led him to have his herbal printed at Cologne 
O ver of Fuchs s blo cks were used in the complete edition of Turner s Herbal and of the rest some are copied from the small er figures in Mattioli s com ment a ry on Dioscorides 
Turner dedicated the first part of his Herbal to the Duke of Somerset un cl e to Edward VI and at that time Lord P ro tect or 
The preface is deli ghtful and I quote a part of it To the mighty and ch ri st ian e P ri nce Edward Duke of Sum mer set Er le of Her for d Lorde Be au ch am pe and Un cl e unto the Kynge s ma ies ty W yl ly am Turner his serva n t w y she th increase in the knowledge of Go ddes holy word e and grace to ly ue there after 
Al though most myghty and Christian P ri nce there be many noble and excellent ac tes and science s which no man d out eth but that al myghty God the author of all good ness hath gyuen unto us by the hands of the He then as necessary unto the use of M an kynd yet is there none among them all why ch is so open ly com ended by the ver d it of any holy writer in the B ible as is ye knowledge of plant es herbes and trees and of Phi sick 
I do not re me m br e that I have red any e express ed commend ation s of Gr am mer Logick Phi l o so p hie natural l or m or all A str on om ie A ri th me ty ke G e om e try Cosmographie M us y cke Perspectiue or any other such lyke science 
But I red e among e the commend at y on s and pray s es of K yng S al om on that he was sene in herbes sh rub be s and trees and so perfect ly that he dis put ed wyse ly of them from the hyghe st to the low est that is from the C ed re t re in M o un t L i b an unto the H y so p that groweth fur th of the w all 
If the Kno w l edge of Herbes sh rub be s and trees which is not the l est necessary thynge unto the knowledge of Phisicke were not great ly commend able it s hu l de never have ben e set among S al om on s commend a cy on s and amongst the sing u la r gift es of God 
There for where as S al om on was commend ed for the Kno w l edge of Herbes the same Kno w l edge was express ed ly y no u gh com ended there also 
C on t in u ing he speak s of learned English men Doctor C le ment Doctor W end y and Doctor O we n Doctor W o l to n and Maister F al con er which have as much knowledge in herbes yea and more than di u ers e It al ian es and German es whyche have set forth in pryn te Herball es and boke s of simple s 
Yet hath none of al these set fur th any thyng other to the gener all pro fit of hole Christ en do me in l at in and to the ho nor of thy s real me ne ther in Englysh to the proper pro fit of their natural l count re 
After s ly ly o b s er v ing that perhaps they do not care to jeopardise their est im ation he com p are s himself for hav ing ven t ure d to write this book with the s old ier who is more f r end ly unto the common we al th which ad ven t u ro us ly run n eth among the my ddes of hys ene my es both gy u yng and ta kyng blow es then he that w hi l se other men f eight stand eth in the top of a t re i u d g ing how other men do he be ynge without the d a nge r of go nne shot himself 
To those who may object that it is too small he ex plains that he will write more ful ly when he has travelled di verse sh yr es in England to learn more of the herbs that grow there 
Other s may con dem n him for writing in English for now say they every man without any study of necessary art es unto the knowledge of Phi sick will be come a Phi s ic ian euery man n a y euery old wyfe will presume not without the m or d re of many to prac ty se Phi sick 
To these he succinct ly rep lies How many sur g ian es and apothecaries are there in England which can understand P l in i in Latin or Galen and Dioscorides 
The English physician s he says re ly on the apothecaries and they in turn on the old w ive s who gather the herbs 
Moreover since the physician s are not present when their prescriptions are made up many a good ma by i g no rance is put in jeopardy of his life or good me dec in e is ma r red to the great dish one s ty both of the Phi s ic ian and of Go ddes worth y creatures 
All this can be avoid ed by hav ing a herbal written in English 
Dioscorides and Galen he point s out wrote in their native to ngue Greek 
D yd Dioscorides and Galen give o c c as ion for every old wyfe to take in had the prac tise of Phi sick 
Did they g i ue any i us t o c c as ion of mu r ther 
If they gaue no occasyon unto every old wyfe to prac tise p hy sik e then give I none 
If they gave no o c c as ion of mu r ther then gyue I none then am I no hynder er wr yt ing unto the English my count re men an English herb all 
The second part of Turner s Herbal is dedicated to his old patron Thomas Lord Wentworth and the complete work including the third part to Queen Elizabeth 
In the preface to this last he re mind s the queen of a con ver s ation he had had with her in Latin eight e en years before at the Duke of Somerset s house when he was physician to that noble man 
It is in this preface also that he cr it ic is es the foreign herbalists though he has learn t much from them they had much to learn from him as their second editions may e testify e 
He claim s that in the first part of his herbal he taught the truth of ce rt eyn e plants which these above named writer s M at th io l us Fuchs i us T r a g us and D o done us either k new not at al or el l is er red in them great ly e And because I would not be lyke unto a cry er yt cry eth a lost e horse in the mark eth and tell eth all the mark es and token s that he hath and yet never saw e the horse ne ther could e know e the horse if he saw e him I went e into Italy e and into di verse parte s of German y to know e and se the herbes my selfe 
The book owes much of its charm to its vivid description s of the plants and the fascinating and un ex pe c ted details he gives us about them 
The com pa r is on of do d der for instance to a great red ha r pe str ynge is a ha p p y touch which it is impossible to for get 
D o der groweth out of herbes and small b us he s as m is ce l to groweth out of trees 
D o der is lyke a great red ha r pe str ynge and it w yn d eth about herbes fold yng my ch about them and hath floures and knoppe s one from an other a good space 
The herbes that I have mark ed do der to grow e most in are flax and t are s 
These ac cur at e observat ion s and care ful description s are character istic of the writer and recall similar touch es in the Saxon herbals 
For example he record s that the sta men s of the M ad on n a lily have a different smell from the flower itself and that the ber rie s of the ba y tree are almost but not quite round 
There is only space to quote the following The lily hath a long stalk and se ld om more than one how be it it hath so m tyme II 
It is II or III c u bite s hyghe 
It hath long leves and so m thyng of the fashion of the great s at yr ion 
The flour is exced yng white and it hath the for me or fashion of a long qui ver that is to say smal at the one end and by g at the other 
The leves of the floures are full of cres tes and the over most ends of the leves b ow e a little back ward e and from the low est parte with in come forth long small ye low thynge s lyke thre de s of another smelle than the floures are of 
The root e is round and one pece groweth hard to another all most e after the maner of the root e of G a r le ke but that the cl owes in the lily are b rode r 
The leaves of the Ba y tree are al waye s grene and in figure and fashion they are lyke unto per i w in cl e 
They are long and b rode st in the mi ddes t of the le fe 
They are black is he grene name ly when they are old e 
They are cur led about the edge s they smell well 
And when they are cast en into the fyre they cr a ke wonderful ly 
The t re in England is no great t re but it th ry v eth there many parte s better and is l us t ier than in German y 
The ber rie s are all most e round but not al together 
The kirnell is cove red with a thick black bark e which may well be part ed from the kirnell 
Blewbottel groweth in ye corn e it hath a stalk e full of corn ers a n a r r ow and long le e fe 
In the top of the stalk e is a k no p p y head where upon grow e blew e flowers about mi d summer 
The chylde r use to make ga r land es of the floure 
It groweth much among e R ye where for e I think e that good ry in an e ve l l and un sea s on able yere do th go out of kind e in to this we de 
P en n y royal It c rep eth much upon the ground and hath many ly tle round leves not un lyke unto the leves of mer ier u m g ent il but that they are a little long er and sharp er and also litle in de n ted round e about and grene r than the leves of mer iurum a r 
The leves grow in litle branch es even from the root e of ce rt a yn io yn tes by equal l space s one de vyded from an other 
Where as the leves grow in litle t u ft es upon the over parte s of the braunches P en n y royal groweth much without any set ting be s yd h un d s ley Ho un s low upon the he th be side a water y place 
Of camomile he writes It hath floures wonderful ly shyn ynge yellow and re s em bl ynge the a ppe l l of an eye the herbe may be called in English golden floure 
It will restore a man to hys col or short ly yf a man after the long e use of the ba the drynk e of it after he is come for the out e of the bath 
This herbe is sca r ce in German y but in England it is so plenteous that it groweth not only in gardyn es but also VI II mi le above London it groweth in the wylde felde in R y ch m on de grene in B r an t fur de grene Thy s herb was consec rate d by the wyse men of Egypt unto the sonne and was re ke n ed to be the only remedy of all a g ues 
Un like modern authorities Turner con t ends that our English hyssop is the same plant as that mentioned in the B ible and he also describe s a species which does not now exist 
We have in Sum ers hi re be side ye come H y so p that groweth in all other places of England e a kind e of H y so p that is al rough e and ho ry and it is greater much e and strong er then the come n H y so p is so m call it rough H y so p 
An other plant which seems to have dis appear ed and which he state s no other writer describe s is the wonderful great col e with leaves th r is e as th i ke as ever I saw any other col e have 
It hath whyte floures and round berry es lyke y v y 
This herbe groweth at d ouer harde by the Sea sy de 
I name it the D ouer col e because I found e it first be sy de D ouer 
Incidentally he mention s s am p hi re also as grow ing at D over 
It is interesting to find that Turner id ent if ies the Herb a Britannica of Dioscorides and Pliny famed for hav ing cure d the soldiers of Ju l i us C es a r of s cur v y in the Rhine country with Po ly go nu m b is to rt a which he observed plentiful ly in Friesl and the s ce ne of Pliny s observat ion s 
This herb is held by more modern authorities to be R u me x a qu ation s great water dock 
Illustration ILLUSTRATIONS FROM TURNER S HERBAL Throughout the Herbal there are re collect ion s of the north of England where the author spent his boyhood 
Of heath for instance he tells us The hy est he the that ever I saw groweth in Nor thumberl and which is so hyghe that a man may hyd e himself in 
Of the wild hy ac in th he writes The boy es in Nor t hu ber land s cr a pe the root e of the herbe and g le w theyr a r r owes and boke s wyth that s ly me that they s cr a pe of 
Of sea wr a ke sea we ed he tells us In the Bishop rich e of Durham the hous b and men of the count ie that d wel by the sea sy de use to fate f at ten i 
e man ure their land e with sea wr a ke 
Under birch we find F is her ers in Nor thumberl and pyll off the ut ter most bark e and put it in the c ly ft of a stick e and set in fyre and hold it at the water sy de and make fi sh come the ther whiche if they se they s try ke with theyr ley st ers or s am m on s per es 
The same he continues is good to make ho o pe s of and twigges for basket tes it is so b ow ing e 
It serve th for many good uses and for none better then for be ting e of st u b born e boy es that e ther ly e or will not learn e 
C u d we ed is called in Nor thumberl and ch a f we de because it is thou ght to be good for ch a f yng of any man s flesh e wyth go ynge or ry d ynge 
And it would be interesting to know if the d a is y is still called b an w u rt in the north 
The Nor the rn men call thy s herbe b an w u rt because it help eth bone s to k n yt agayne P l in ie write th that the d as e y hath III and some times IV little whyte leves whiche go about the ye low k no pe it a p per eth that the double D as e ys were not found e in pl in ies tyme why ch have a great e de le mo then P l in i make th mention of 
There are other country custom s which he record s 
She p her d s use c liv ers goo se grass in stede of a stra y ner to pu l l out here of the my l ke b i r der ers b i r d catch ers take bowes of birch and l im e the twigges and go a b at fol ing e with them so m make a le e ly e or an as hy water of the rotes of g ent ian w her wyth they toke out spot tes very well out of cloth 
He mention s wo ad as tri m med wyth m annes l ab or in d ye nge and w u l l and cloth e and teazle which the full ers dres se their cloth wt all 
Ap pa rent ly Turner gave the sp in d le tree its name for he says I could e never learn e an English e name for it 
The D u che men call it in N e ther land e spilboome that is sp in del tree because they use to make sp in del s of it in that count re y and me thy n ke it may e be so well named in English se ying we have no other name 
I know no good proper t ie that this tree hath sav ing only it is good to make sp in del s and br id of c ages b i r d c ages 
The use of com pl ex ion was he s was a custom on which Turner was al a r m ing ly s ever e 
There are few er beauty recipes in his herbal than in any other only four al together 
Some we o men we find spr in k le ye floures of c ows l i p w t whyte wine and after still it and wash their face s w t that water to drive wr in k les away and to make them fayr e in the eyes of the worlde rather then in the eyes of God whom they are not a f ray d to off end 
And of mary gold we learn that Sum me use to make theyr here ye low with the floure of this herbe not be yng con t et with the natural l colour which God hath g even the 
There is curiously little folk lore in this herbal and most of it is guard ed by some do say or some hold 
N ever the less with this qu a lif ic ation Turner gives us fragments of folk lore not to be found in other herbals 
For instance that nu ts he l l s burn t and bound to the back of a child s head will make grey eyes black and that pa rs ley throw n into fi sh p on d s will heal the sick fishes there in 
Again this is the first herbal in which any account is to be found of the very old custom of curing disease in cattle by b or ing a hole in the ear and in s er ting the herb bear foot 
They say it should be used thus 
The b rode st part of the ear must have a round circle made about it w t the blood that r in n eth fur th with a br as en botken and the same circle must be round lyke unto the letter O and when this is done without and in the high er part of the ear the halfe of the for e said circle is to be b or ed th or ow e with the for e said botken and the root e of the herbe is to be put in at the hole when y t newe wound e that hath re ce y ued it hold eth it so fast that it will not let it go fur th then all the might e and p est il ent p o is on of the disease is brought so into the e are 
And w hi l se the part which is circle d about e dy eth and fall eth a waye y t hole beast is sav ed with the l os e of a very small parte 
An other piece of folk lore is remarkable because it is the only instance in an English herbal of a belief in the effect of a human being on a plant If ye would e fayne have very large and great e g our de s then take sede s that grow e there in the sides And let we o men ne ther touch e the y on ge g our de s nor loke upon them for the only touch ing e and s ight e of we o men k ill e the y on ge g our de s 
This belief he quote s from Pliny 
Turner again is the only old herbal is t who refers to the old and widespread belief that la r ch was fire pro of 
It was large ly used he tells us for lay ing under the tile s of new ly b u il t house s as a sure defen ce against burn ing and he n a r rate s at length how Ju l i us C es a r was unable to burn a to we r b u il t with la r ch 
On the old mandrake legend he is sca th ing 
The root es which are count er fit ed and made like litle pu ppe t tes and m am me t tes which come to be s old in England in boxes with he i r hair and such for me as man hath are no thyng el les but fol is he fen ed tri fle s and not natural l 
For they are so try m med of craft y the ve s to mo cke the poor e people with all and to ro b them both of theyr wit and theyr m one y 
I have in my tyme at di verse tyme s take up the root es of mandrake out of the ground e but I never saw any such thyng upon or in them as are in and upon the ped l ers root es that are come n ly to be s old e in boxes 
It groweth not under g al loses g all ows as a ce rt a yn do ting doctor of Col on in his physic k lecture dy d teach hys au d it or s 
But he accept s without question the belief in its efficacy as an anesthetic It is given to those who must be burn ed or cut in some place that they should not fele the burn ing or cut t yng 
Of wine made of it he says If they drynk thy s drynk e they shall fele no pa yn e but they shall fall into a for get full and s le p is he dr ows in es s 
Of the apple s of mandrake if a man smell of them thei will make hym slepe and also if they be eaten 
But they that smell to much e of the apple s be come du m thy s herbe di verse waye s taken is very j e pa r du s for a man and may k ill hym if he eat it or drynk it out of measu re and have no remedy from it 
If man drag or a be taken out of measu re by and by slepe en su eth and a great lou sing of the str e yng the with a for get ful ness 
Turner is one of the few herbalists who c a ut ion s against the ex cess ive use of any herb 
On ion s eaten in meat large ly make the head a ke they make them for get full whiche in the tyme of sy k ne s use them out of me sure 
Col e en g end r eth euell and melancho lie juice 
It dul l eth the sy ght and it troub l eth the slepe wyth contrary thynge s which are sene in the d re me 
Of n ige l la he writes Take he de that ye take not to much e of this herbe for if ye go beyond e the me sure it brynge th d eth 
He m p seed he says if it be taken out of measu re take th men s wytte s from the as c or ian der do th 
If any person use s a f fro n measu r ab ly it make th in them a good colour but if thei use it out of me sure it make th hym loke pale and make th the he de ache and hurt eth the appetite 
For those who have taken an over do se of o p ium there is a surprising remedy 
If the pa ci ent be to much s le p i put stynkynge thynge s unto hys nose to w aken hym there with 
As in all herbals of this period there are an as to n is h ing number of remedies against melancho ly and suggestion s for those whose we ak brains will not stand much strong drink but while remedies for broken head s so common in the older herbals are conspicuous ly ab sent we find that wal nu ts are re commend ed for the by ting s both of men and dog ge s 
As in the Grete Herball there are many description s of other substance s be sides herbs some of the long est being of dates ric e o live s cit r on pomegranates and l ent il s 
The account of cit r on it would be pleasant to tran scribe in full not for the sake of the story but for the man ner of the tell ing 
One could list en to a sermon of consider able length from a divine who in a book in t ended for grown up s has a tale of two nau ght y mu r the ring robbers con dem n ed for theyr mu r der and ro be ry to be f lay n and p o ys on ed to d eth of serpent es and such ven e mou s best es and of the one who ow ing to hav ing eaten a pece of cit r on remain ed D an ie l like un hurt by the p o is on of the snakes w hi l st the other who had not taken this pre c a ut ion fell down s ter k de de 
And finally the m or al Where for e it were w is do me that noble men and other that are by d de n to d yn ner of theyr enemies or s us pe c ted frendes before they eat any other thyng should take a pece of cit r on 
The later sixteenth century herbalists owed much to the famous herbalists of the N e ther land s and above all to that prince amongst pu bl is her s Christ o p he Pla n t in of An t we r p whose personal ity secu red him a unique place in the literary world 
In deed there is a splen d our about the works of the F le mi sh herbalists un equal led by any others of this period with the exception of the Ba va ri an doctor Leonhard Fuchs 
There is no com pa r is on between them and the It al ian herbalists of the R en a is s a nce who for the greater part de v o ted themselves to studying the classical writer s and identify ing the plants mentioned by the old authorities 
France curiously enough con tri but ed comparative ly little when the herbal was at its zenith though it must of course be remembe red that the B au h in s who r an k as Swiss herbalists were of French extract ion 
But it is difficult to est im at e the influence of the works of those three not able friend s Rembert Dodoen s Charles de l Escl use and Matthias de l Obel particular ly on the English herbalists 
The most famous English herbal Gerard s is vi rt ual ly a translation of the P em pt a de s of Dodoen s 
Lyte s translation of the Cruydtboeck was the sta ndard work on herbs during the latter part of the century and Parkinson incorporated a large part of de l Obel s un finished book in his The atrum Botanicum 
De l Obel after whom the little garden flower lobelia is named spent the greater part of his life in England 
He was a F le m ing by birth and a doctor by pro fes s ion and he was physician to William the S il ent until his as s as s in ation 
A b out he came over to England with his friend P en a who at one time was physician to Louis XII I 
and lived at High ga te with his s on in la w 
He super in t ended Lord Zou che s garden at Hackney and later was given the title of botanist to James I L Obel s great work written in col l ab or ation with P en a was the St i r p ium A d ver s ari a No va printed in London by Thomas Purfoot in 
Pul ten e y in his B io graphic al S ke tche s make s the ex tr a or d in a ry statement that Christ o p he Pla n t in of An t we r p was the real printer 
It has however been pointed out by modern authorities that the a r ch ive s of the Pla n t in Museum show that Pla n t in b ought copies of Purfoot s edition with the wood blo cks for fl or in s 
In Pla n t in published de l Obel s Pla n t arum se u St i r p ium his to ri a and to this he a p p ended the first part of the A d ver s ari a keep ing Purfoot s original col ophon 
Al though Dodoen s neither lived in England nor had any of his works printed here his Cruydtboeck became one of the sta ndard works in this country through Lyte s translation 
Dodoen s was born at M a lines about and after studying at L o u va in visit ed the uni ver s it ies and medical school s of France Italy and German y g r a du a ted M D and was a p pointed physician to Max im il ian II 
and R u do l f II

In the latter part of his life he was Professor of Medicine at Le yd en where he died in 
Pla n t in published Dodoen s s most important work St i r p ium his to rie p em pt a de s s ex s ive l i br i tri g in ta in which some of the figures are copied from the fifth century manuscript copy of Dioscorides 
Dodoen s s first book the Cruydtboeck was translated into French by his friend Charles de l Escl use and afterwards into English by Henry Lyte 
Lyte who was an Oxford man travelled ex ten s ive ly in his youth and made a collect ion of r are plants 
He con tri but ed nothing original to the literature on herbs but his translation of the French ver s ion of the Cruydtboeck was an in est im able s er vi ce 
His own copy of the French ver s ion which is now in the British Museum has on the title page the quaint in scription Henry Lyte taught me to speak e English e 
The book is full of MS not es and references to Turner 
The full title of Lyte s book is as follows A n ie we Herball or His to rie of Pla n tes where in is con ta yned the whole dis course and perfect description of all sort es of Herbes and Pla n tes their di ver s and sun dry kind es their stra un ge F i g ure s Fashions and S ha pe s their N am es Nature s O per ation s and V er t ues and that not only of those which are here grow yng in this our C o un tri e of England e but of all others also of for rayne R e al me s commonly used in Phy sick e 
First set f o or th in the D out che or Al ma i g ne to ngue by that learned D Rembert Dodoen s Phy s it ion to the E m per our And no we first translated out of French into English by Henry Lyte E s qu y er 
Colophon I m printed at An t we r pe by M e Henry L o e Book e printer and are to be s old e at London in P au l s church yard e by Gerard De we s 
The beautiful illustration s in Lyte s Dodoen s are to a large extent printed from the same blo cks as those in the octavo edition of Fuchs 
In Fuchs there are about illustration s and in Lyte s Dodoen s about 
Those which are not copied from Fuchs were probably collect ed by Dodoen s himself who according to some verses at the beginning of the herbal took a prac tical interest in the public ation of the English translation of his book 
T ill Rembert he did s ende addition s s to re For to au g ment Lyte s tr a ve l l past before 
The original wood blo cks never came to England and three years later v an der L o e s w id ow s old them to Christ o p he Pla n t in for fl or in s 
All the commend a to ry verses at the beginning of Lyte s herbal are in Latin except some lines in which William C low es speak s of writing about herbs as a fit occupati on for gentleme n and w ight s of worth y f a me and recall s the great men who have immortalised themselves there by notably G ent i us L ys im a ch us Myth ri dates and Dioscorides 
Then after g i v ing due praise to Dodoen s Who se learned skill hath of fer ed first this worth y work e to ve we C low es ends with four lines in which he play s upon the name of the translator And Lyte whose t oyle hath not ben e light to d ye it in this g rayne De serve s no light regard e of us but than ke s and than ke s agayne 
And sure I am all English harte s that lyke of Phy sick es lore W ill also lyke this g ent le man and than ke hym much e therefore 
The herbal is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth as the best token of love and d il ige nce that I am at this time able to she w And doubt less if my skill in the translation were an s we r able to the worth y nesse e y ther of the His to rie itself e or of the A u thou rs thereof I doubt not but I should be thou ght to haue h on our ed your M a i est ie with an accept able present 
The preface is date d from my poor e house at Lyte s c a rie with in your M a i est ies Countie of Somerset the first day of Jan u a rie M D L XXV III 
In there appear ed the book commonly known as Ram s little Dodoen 
It pu r p or ted to be an ep i to me of Lyte s Dodoen s but though some of its matter has been abridged from Dodoen s s work it is in reality a compil ation of recipes unworthy of the great name it bear s 
In his preface the author tells us I have best owed some tyme in re duc ing the most ex qu is it new herb all or history of plants first set forth in Dutch and Al may ne to ngue by the learned and worth y man of famous memory Dr Rembert D o de on s ic Phi s ic ian to the Emperor and translated into English by Master Henry Lyte Esq 
with a brief and short ep i to me so as where the great booke at large is not to be had but at a great price which cannot be pro cure d by the poor er sort my ende v or herein hath b in chief ly to make the be nefit of so good necessary and pro fit able a work e to be brought with in the r each and com pass e as well of you my poor e country men and women whose live s health s e as e and wel fare is to be regarded with the rest at a small er price than the great volume is 
My one ly and great est care hath by n of long tyme to know e or think e how and upon whom e to best ow the d ed ic ation of this my small labour 
And in the p en n ing of this my letter my A f fect ion s are satisf ied with the d ed ic ation thereof to these my poor e and loving country men who soever and to whose hands soever it may come 
For whose sake I have desire d public at io of the same beseech ing Al mighty God to bless e us all 
The book is curiously arranged for on one page we have the practice of Dodoen and on the opposite the prac tise s of others for the same Phi sik e helpe s collect ed and present ed to the A u th or of this Treatise 
There are direct ion s for each month and each is head ed by a mo t to 
The twelve mo t to es when read together form the following quaint rhyme January 
With this fyre I warm e my hand F e bruary 
With this spade I dig ge my land March 
Here I cut my V in e spr ing Ap ril 
Here I hear the birds sing May 
I am as fresh as b i r d on b o u gh Ju ne

With this fl a il e I ear ne my bread O c to ber 
Here I so we my wheat s so red No ve m ber 
With this a x e I k ill my swine December 
And here I br e w both ale and wine 
There are some things in this little hand book worth y of re me m b rance notably an im a g i native pass age in which the author tells us that herbs that grow in the fields are better than those which grow in gardens and of those herbs which grow in the fi e ldes such as grow on hill es are best

It has been sugges ted that Turner was imprisoned for his re f us al to sub scribe to the Six Art ic les and that he re can ted to sav e his life 
But as Dr B D J a cks on has pointed out Turner was made of s ter ner stuff and his whole life and writings are a stand ing con tr ad ic t ion to any such s up position 
One of the earliest botani c gardens in Europe was at Bologna 
It was found ed by Luca Ghini 
It is interesting to see how frequently Turner in his herbal quote s Ghini and cit es his authority against other com ment at or s 
Luca Ghini was the first who ere c ted a separa te pro fessor i al c hair at Bologna for Botanical S ci ence 
He himself lecture d on Dioscorides for twenty eight years 
He was the pre ce pt or of C a es al p in us and An qu ill a r a two of the sound est cr it ic s on botani c al writings of that age 
The most famous public botani c al gardens in Europe during the sixteenth seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries were the following 
I give them in the order in which they were made P a du a 
Flor ence 
Bologna 
Paris 
Montpellier 
J en a 
Oxford 
Upsala 
C he l sea 
E d in bur gh 
Le yd en 
A m s ter dam 
Utrecht 
The first botani c garden in America was found ed in Phi la del p hi a by John B art r am the great America n botanist in the middle of the eighteenth century 
Gesner had a high opinion of Turner of whom he wrote An te an nos a ut circ it er c u m Anglicus ex It al i a red i en s me s al ut are t Turner us is f u er it vi r excellent is t u m in re me dica t u m al i is pl er is qu e dis ci pl in is do c tr in a e a ut al i us qu is qu am vi x s at is me mini 
De Herb is L un ari is 
The Duke of Somerset was himself ke en ly interest ed in botani c al in v est i g ation s and Turner frequently refers to the Duke s garden 
It was during this time that Turner had his own garden at Kew 
That he s at in the Ho use of Commons is general ly supposed from a pass age in his S p i r it ual Phy sik and this view is sustained by the character of the Hunt er in his R om is h W o l fe 
It has been as s er ted in some account s of Turner that he was a C an on of W in d s or but this is a m is take 
The C an on of W in d s or was Richard Turner also a Protestant and like the herbal is t ex il ed during Mary s reign 
Turner s w id ow subsequent ly marri ed Richard C ox who became Bishop of E ly 
She found ed a scholars hip at Cambridge in memory of her first hu s b and 
It was for the same reason that Henry Lyte s translation of Dodoen s was printed abroad 
P ier and re a Mattioli was physician successive ly to the Arch du ke F er d in and and to the Emperor Max im il ian II 
With the exception of F ab io Col on n a he was the great est of the It al ian herbalists 
This was probably the John F al con er who sent English plants to A ma tus L us it an us who taught physic at Ferrara and An con a and whose com ment a ry on Dioscorides was published in 
Queen Elizabeth s love of garden ing and her botani c al knowledge were ce le br a ted in a long Latin poem by an It al ian who visit ed England in and wrote under the name of M el is s us see Arch eologia VI I 

Parkinson in his The atrum Botanicum also mention s this use of bear foot 
He studied medicine at M on t pe lie r under G u ill au me R on de let who be qu eathed him his botani c al manuscripts
